  abstract = {Accurate crop type mapping provides numerous benefits for a deeper understanding of food systems and yield prediction. Ever-increasing big data, easy access to high-resolution imagery, and cloud-based analytics platforms like Google Earth Engine have drastically improved the ability for scientists to advance data-driven agriculture with improved algorithms for crop type mapping using remote sensing, computer vision, and machine learning. Crop type mapping techniques mainly relied on standalone SAR and optical imagery, few studies investigated the potential of SAR-optical data fusion, coupled with virtual constellation, and 3-dimensional (3D) deep learning networks. To this extent, we use a deep learning approach that utilizes the denoised backscatter and texture information from multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data and the spectral information from multi-temporal optical Sentinel-2 data for mapping ten different crop types, as well as water, soil and urban area. Multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data was fused with multi-temporal optical Sentinel-2 data in an effort to improve classification ac­ curacies for crop types. We compared the results of the 3D U-Net to the state-of-the-art deep learning networks, including SegNet and 2D U-Net, as well as commonly used machine learning method such as Random Forest. The results showed (1) fusing multi-temporal SAR and optical data yields higher training overall accuracies (OA) (3D U-Net 0.992, 2D U-Net 0.943, SegNet 0.871) and testing OA (3D U-Net 0.941, 2D U-Net 0.847, SegNet 0.643) for crop type mapping compared to standalone multi-temporal SAR or optical data (2) optical data fused with denoised SAR data via a denoising convolution neural network (OA 0.912) performed better for crop type mapping compared to optical data fused with boxcar (OA 0.880), Lee (OA 0.881), and median (OA 0.887) filtered SAR data and (3) 3D convolutional neural networks perform better than 2D convolutional neural net­ works for crop type mapping (SAR OA 0.912, optical OA 0.937, fused OA 0.992).},

This study presents global-scale potential coastal overtopping estimates, which account for not only the effects of sea level rise and storm surge, but also for wave runup at exposed open coasts. Here we find that the globally aggregated annual overtopping hours have increased by almost 50\% over the last two decades. A first-pass future assessment indicates that globally aggregated annual overtopping hours will accelerate faster than the global mean sea-level rise itself, with a clearly discernible increase occurring around mid-century regardless of climate scenario. Under RCP 8.5, the globally aggregated annual overtopping hours by the end of the 21st-century is projected to be up to 50 times larger compared to present-day. As sea level continues to rise, more regions around the world are projected to become exposed to coastal overtopping.},

Here we present S2Shores (Satellite to Shores), the first sub-kilometer global atlas of coastal bathymetry based on depth inversion from wave kinematics captured by the Sentinel-2 constellation. The methodology reveals coastal seafloors up to a hundred meters in depth which allows covering most continental shelves and represents 4.9 million km2 along the world coastline. Although the vertical accuracy (RMSE 6–9 m) is currently coarser than that of traditional surveying techniques, S2Shores is of particular interest to countries that do not have the means to carry out in situ surveys and to unexplored regions such as polar areas. S2Shores is a major step forward in mitigating the effects of global changes on coastal communities and ecosystems by providing scientists, engineers, and policy makers with new science-based decision tools.},

CASSIE use the Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, freely available from GEE, and implements an automatic shoreline detection using the normalized difference water index (NDWI) together with Otsu image segmentation algorithm. The satellite-derived shorelines are analysed for a set of user-defined cross-shore transects along which several statistical analyses are performed. Comparisons of the CASSIE-derived shorelines and rate of changes with state-of-the art methods show that the products from this tool have sub-pixel accuracy. The new concept of big-data cloud-based computing and storage platform (GEE), together with a user-friendly interface and high level of automation makes of CASSIE a complete tool to support a wide variety of studies and applications where the knowledge of the shoreline behaviour is fundamental.},

  abstract = {The shoreline is a useful indicator of mid-term coastal evolution. Every shoreline is affected by instantaneous sea-level, the length of the run-up, and beach profile changes. In this work, annual mean shorelines are evaluated in a manner that avoids these effects by averaging the instantaneous shoreline positions registered during the same year. A set of 270 shorelines obtained from Landsat imagery between 2000 and 2014, using the method described in Pardo-Pascual et al. (2012), have been used. It has been shown that the use of annual mean shorelines enables the same rate of change to be obtained as when using all the shorelines, but that the data is simpler to manage and more useful when visualising local changes. It has also been shown that annual mean shorelines largely remove the short-term variability, and are therefore useful for analysing mid-term trend quantifications. In addition, we propose a methodology for annual mean shorelines, obtained from Landsat imagery, that minimises the effects of sea-level variation on the shoreline positions. Both shorelines – instantaneous and mean annual – appear to be about 4 or 5m seaward from those obtained using more precise sources.},

  abstract = {Complex and highly variable parameters of water quality are difficult to predict over time and space. In most cases, predictions of surface chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and sea surface temperature (SST) are based on coupled ecological-hydrodynamic modeling, which is driven by oceanic and climatic conditions. Since these models are complex, simpler and efficient methods of predictions are required. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of stochastic time series models - Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) and nonlinear neural network (NN) - to predict Chl-a and SST in coastal areas. Additionally, this study examines the sensitivity of the aforementioned models with respect to variation in depth and changes in turbidity. The data used in this study are satellite-derived Chl-a and SST collected for the Arabian Gulf region for a period of 10 years. This region has been selected for the study due to pronounced variability in depth and changes in turbidity in its waters. As a result of this study, it has been shown that SARIMA and NN are able to forecast Chl-a and SST. In the deep \& less turbid water, SARIMA and NN models (SARIMA/NN) produced Chl-a R2:RMSE values of (0.5:0.6)/(0.37:0.53) and SST R2:RMSE (0.9:1.36)/(0.8:1.43). However, the NN has performed better than SARIMA in predicting Chl-a in turbid \& shallow waters, especially when Chl-a concentrations are high ({$>$}2~mgm−3). Based on our analysis, we conclude that SARIMA and NN are capable of forecasting the future values of Chl-a and SST in regions with pre-existing knowledge of the water depth and turbidity.},

In IH-LANS, a hybrid (statistical-numerical) deep-water propagation module and a data-assimilated shoreline evolution model are coupled. Longshore and cross-shore processes are integrated together with the effects of man-made in­ terventions. For every simulation, shoreline changes in response to time varying wave conditions and water levels are evaluated while reducing calibration uncertainty by means of an extended Kalman filter that allows to assimilate shoreline observations. To test model performance, IH-LANS is applied to a highly anthropized 40 km stretch located along the Spanish Mediterranean coast. The model is run during the period 1990–2020 using high space-time resolution climate data and satellite-derived shorelines in order to calibrate the free parameters and validate model outputs. Shoreline evolution is successfully represented ({$<$}10 m of root mean square error, RMSE) while accounting for the effects of nourishments and the construction and removal of groynes, seawalls and breakwaters over time. The efficiency of the model makes IH-LANS a powerful tool for coastal management and climate change adaptation.},

Thirty hourly time series of shoreline evolution between 2020 and 2100 are obtained, each of them linked to one future realization of waves and water levels. From the shoreline time-series analysis, long and short -term processes are unraveled, yielding permanent retreats and beach area losses, contribution of individual physical processes (longshore, short-term cross-shore, and SLR) to shoreline change and non-stationary extreme retreats. The methodology presented herein is intended to be a useful tool for evaluating potential climate change risks while enabling the evaluation and prioritization of adaptation measures.},

  abstract = {The ability of the Canadian agriculture sector to make better decisions and manage its operations more competitively in the long term is only as good as the information available to inform decision-making. At all levels of Government, a reliable flow of information between scientists, practitioners, policy-makers, and commodity groups is critical for developing and supporting agricultural policies and programs. Given the vastness and complexity of Canada’s agricultural regions, space-based remote sensing is one of the most reliable approaches to get detailed information describing the evolving state of the country’s environment. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC)—the Canadian federal department responsible for agriculture—produces the Annual Space-Based Crop Inventory (ACI) maps for Canada. These maps are valuable operational space-based remote sensing products which cover the agricultural land use and non-agricultural land cover found within Canada’s agricultural extent. Developing and implementing novel methods for improving these products are an ongoing priority of AAFC. Consequently, it is beneficial to implement advanced machine learning and big data processing methods along with open-access satellite imagery to effectively produce accurate ACI maps. In this study, for the first time, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform was used along with an Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) algorithm and Sentinel-1, -2 images to produce an object-based ACI map for 2018. Furthermore, different limitations of the proposed method were discussed, and several suggestions were provided for future studies. The Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Coefficient (KC) of the final 2018 ACI map using the proposed GEE cloud method were 77\% and 0.74, respectively. Moreover, the average Producer Accuracy (PA) and User Accuracy (UA) for the 17 cropland classes were 79\% and 77\%, respectively. Although these levels of accuracies were slightly lower than those of the AAFC’s ACI map, this study demonstrated that the proposed cloud computing method should be investigated further because it was more efficient in terms of cost, time, computation, and automation.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic warming has led to an unprecedented year-round reduction in Arctic sea ice extent. This has far-reaching consequences for indigenous and local communities, polar ecosystems, and global climate, motivating the need for accurate seasonal sea ice forecasts. While physics-based dynamical models can successfully forecast sea ice concentration several weeks ahead, they struggle to outperform simple statistical benchmarks at longer lead times. We present a probabilistic, deep learning sea ice forecasting system, IceNet. The system has been trained on climate simulations and observational data to forecast the next 6 months of monthly-averaged sea ice concentration maps. We show that IceNet advances the range of accurate sea ice forecasts, outperforming a state-of-the-art dynamical model in seasonal forecasts of summer sea ice, particularly for extreme sea ice events. This step-change in sea ice forecasting ability brings us closer to conservation tools that mitigate risks associated with rapid sea ice loss.},

  abstract = {Coastal area constitutes a vulnerable environment and requires special attention to preserve ecosystems and human activities therein. To this aim, many studies have been devoted both in past and recent years to analyzing the main factors affecting coastal vulnerability and susceptibility. Among the most used approaches, the Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) accounts for all relevant variables that characterize the coastal environment dealing with: (i) forcing actions (waves, tidal range, sea-level rise, etc.), (ii) morphological characteristics (geomorphology, foreshore slope, dune features, etc.), (iii) socio-economic, ecological and cultural aspects (tourism activities, natural habitats, etc.). Each variable is evaluated at each portion of the investigated coast, and associated with a vulnerability level which usually ranges from 1 (very low vulnerability), to 5 (very high vulnerability). Following a susceptibility/vulnerability analysis of a coastal stretch, specific strategies must be chosen and implemented to favor coastal resilience and adaptation, spanning from hard solutions (e.g., groins, breakwaters, etc.) to soft solutions (e.g., beach and dune nourishment projects), to the relocation option and the establishment of accommodation strategies (e.g., emergency preparedness).},

  abstract = {As international concern for the survival of deltas grows, the Mekong River delta, the world’s third largest delta, densely populated, considered as Southeast Asia’s most important food basket and rich in biodiversity at the world scale, is also increasingly affected by human activities and exposed to subsidence and coastal erosion. Several dams have been constructed upstream of the delta and many more are now planned. We quantify from high-resolution SPOT 5 satellite images large-scale shoreline erosion and land loss between 2003 and 2012 that now affect over 50\% of the once strongly advancing \textbackslash textgreater600 km-long delta shoreline. Erosion, with no identified change in the river’s discharge and in wave and wind conditions over this recent period, is consistent with: (1) a reported significant decrease in coastal surface suspended sediment from the Mekong that may be linked to dam retention of its sediment, (2) large-scale commercial sand mining in the river and delta channels and (3) subsidence due to groundwater extraction. Shoreline erosion is already responsible for displacement of coastal populations. It is an additional hazard to the integrity of this Asian mega delta now considered particularly vulnerable to accelerated subsidence and sea-level rise and will be exacerbated by future hydropower dams.},

Here we present a hybrid shoreline change—foredune erosion model (A COupled CrOss-shOre, loNg-shorE, and foreDune evolution model, COCOONED) intended to inform coastal planning and adaptation. COCOONED accounts for coupled longshore and cross-shore processes at different timescales, including sequencing and clustering of storm events, seasonal, interannual, and decadal oscillations by incorporating the effects of integrated varying wave action and water levels for coastal hazard assessment. COCOONED is able to adapt shoreline change rates in response to interactions between longshore transport, cross-shore transport, water level variations, and foredune erosion. COCOONED allows for the spatial and temporal extension of survey data using global data sets of waves and water levels for assessing the behavior of the shoreline at multiple time and spatial scales. As a case study, we train the model in the period 2004–2014 (11 years) with seasonal topographic beach profile surveys from the North Beach Sub-cell (NBSC) of the Columbia River Littoral Cell (Washington, USA). We explore the shoreline response and foredune erosion along 40 km of beach at several timescales during the period 1979–2014 (35 years), revealing an accretional trend producing reorientation of the beach, cross-shore accretional, and erosional periods through time (breathing) and alternating beach rotations that are correlated with climate indices.},

This assumption is valid for small angles between the wave crest lines and the shore, as has been demonstrated in shoreline models1. But when the angle between the waves and the shoreline is sufficiently large, small perturbations to a straight shoreline will grow2,3. Here we use a numerical model to investigate the implications of this instability mechanism for large-scale morphology over long timescales. Our simulations show growth of coastline perturbations that interact with each other to produce large-scale features that resemble various kinds of natural landforms, including the capes and cuspate forelands observed along the Carolina coast of southeastern North America. Wind and wave data from this area support our hypothesis that such an instability mechanism could be responsible for the formation of shoreline features at spatial scales up to hundreds of kilometres and temporal scales up to millennia.},

  abstract = {Nearshore slope, defined as the cross-shore gradient of the subaqueous profile, is an important input parameter which affects hydrodynamic and morphological coastal processes. It is used in both local and largescale coastal investigations. However, due to unavailability of data, most studies, especially those that focus on continental or global scales, have historically adopted a uniform nearshore slope. This simplifying assumption could however have far-reaching implications for predictions/projections thus obtained. Here, we present the first global dataset of nearshore slopes with a resolution of 1 km at almost 620 000 points along the global coastline. To this end, coastal profiles were constructed using global topo-bathymetric datasets. The results show that the nearshore slopes vary substantially around the world. An assessment of coastline recession driven by sea level rise (SLR) (for an arbitrary 0.5 m SLR) with a globally uniform coastal slope of 1 : 100, as carried out in previous studies, and with the spatially variable coastal slopes computed herein shows that, on average, the former approach would underestimate coastline recession by about 40 \%, albeit with significant spatial variation. The final dataset has been made publicly available at https://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:a8297dcd-c34e-4e6d-bf669fb8913d983d (Athanasiou, 2019).},

  abstract = {We present a novel and practical deep fully convolutional neural network architecture for semantic pixel-wise segmentation termed SegNet. This core trainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a corresponding decoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architecture of the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional layers in the VGG16 network [1]. The role of the decoder network is to map the low resolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for pixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which the decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically, the decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the corresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates the need for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are then convolved with trainable filters to produce dense feature maps. We compare our proposed architecture with the widely adopted FCN [2] and also with the well known DeepLab-LargeFOV [3], DeconvNet [4] architectures. This comparison reveals the memory versus accuracy trade-off involved in achieving good segmentation performance. SegNet was primarily motivated by scene understanding applications. Hence, it is designed to be efficient both in terms of memory and computational time during inference. It is also significantly smaller in the number of trainable parameters than other competing architectures and can be trained end-to-end using stochastic gradient descent. We also performed a controlled benchmark of SegNet and other architectures on both road scenes and SUN RGB-D indoor scene segmentation tasks. These quantitative assessments show that SegNet provides good performance with competitive inference time and most efficient inference memory-wise as compared to other architectures. We also provide a Caffe implementation of SegNet and a web demo at http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet/.},

  abstract = {The global decline in estuarine and coastal ecosystems (ECEs) is affecting a number of critical benefits, or ecosystem services. We review the main ecological services across a variety of ECEs, including marshes, mangroves, nearshore coral reefs, seagrass beds, and sand beaches and dunes. Where possible, we indicate estimates of the key economic values arising from these services, and discuss how the natural variability of ECEs impacts their benefits, the synergistic relationships of ECEs across seascapes, and management implications. Although reliable valuation estimates are beginning to emerge for the key services of some ECEs, such as coral reefs, salt marshes, and mangroves, many of the important benefits of seagrass beds and sand dunes and beaches have not been assessed properly. Even for coral reefs, marshes, and mangroves, important ecological services have yet to be valued reliably, such as cross-ecosystem nutrient transfer (coral reefs), erosion control (marshes), and pollution control (mangroves). An important issue for valuing certain ECE services, such as coastal protection and habitat–fishery linkages, is that the ecological functions underlying these services vary spatially and temporally. Allowing for the connectivity between ECE habitats also may have important implications for assessing the ecological functions underlying key ecosystems services, such coastal protection, control of erosion, and habitat–fishery linkages. Finally, we conclude by suggesting an action plan for protecting and/or enhancing the immediate and longer-term values of ECE services. Because the connectivity of ECEs across land–sea gradients also influences the provision of certain ecosystem services, management of the entire seascape will be necessary to preserve such synergistic effects. Other key elements of an action plan include further ecological and economic collaborative research on valuing ECE services, improving institutional and legal frameworks for management, controlling and regulating destructive economic activities, and developing ecological restoration options.},

However, most studies of future coastal vulnerability do not account for the dynamic components of coastal water levels during storms, notably wave-driven processes, storm surges and seasonal water level anomalies, although these components can add metres to water levels during extreme events. Here we synthesize multi-decadal, co-located data assimilated between 1979 and 2012 that describe wave climate, local water levels and coastal change for 48 beaches throughout the Pacific Ocean basin. We find that observed coastal erosion across the Pacific varies most closely with El Niño/Southern Oscillation, with a smaller influence from the Southern Annular Mode and the Pacific North American pattern. In the northern and southern Pacific Ocean, regional wave and water level anomalies are significantly correlated to a suite of climate indices, particularly during boreal winter; conditions in the northeast Pacific Ocean are often opposite to those in the western and southern Pacific. We conclude that, if projections for an increasing frequency of extreme El Niño and La Niña events over the twenty-first century are confirmed, then populated regions on opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean basin could be alternately exposed to extreme coastal erosion and flooding, independent of sea-level rise.},

Here we present a dynamic modeling approach that estimates climate-driven changes in flood-hazard exposure by integrating the effects of SLR, tides, waves, storms, and coastal change (i.e. beach erosion and cliff retreat). We show that for California, USA, the world’s 5th largest economy, over \$150 billion of property equating to more than 6\% of the state’s GDP and 600,000 people could be impacted by dynamic flooding by 2100; a three-fold increase in exposed population than if only SLR and a static coastline are considered. The potential for underestimating societal exposure to coastal flooding is greater for smaller SLR scenarios, up to a seven-fold increase in exposed population and economic interests when considering storm conditions in addition to SLR. These results highlight the importance of including climate-change driven dynamic coastal processes and impacts in both short-term hazard mitigation and long-term adaptation planning.},

  abstract = {Cross-validation is a widely-used technique to estimate prediction error, but its behavior is complex and not fully understood. Ideally, one would like to think that cross-validation estimates the prediction error for the model at hand, fit to the training data. We prove that this is not the case for the linear model fit by ordinary least squares; rather it estimates the average prediction error of models fit on other unseen training sets drawn from the same population. We further show that this phenomenon occurs for most popular estimates of prediction error, including data splitting, bootstrapping, and Mallow’s Cp. Next, the standard confidence intervals for prediction error derived from cross-validation may have coverage far below the desired level. Because each data point is used for both training and testing, there are correlations among the measured accuracies for each fold, and so the usual estimate of variance is too small. We introduce a nested cross-validation scheme to estimate this variance more accurately, and show empirically that this modification leads to intervals with approximately correct coverage in many examples where traditional cross-validation intervals fail. Lastly, our analysis also shows that when producing confidence intervals for prediction accuracy with simple data splitting, one should not re-fit the model on the combined data, since this invalidates the confidence intervals.},

  abstract = {Population figures are usually collected by national statistical institutes at small enumeration units (e.g. census tracts or building units). However, still for many countries in Europe, data are distributed at coarser geographical units like municipalities. This level of resolution is insufficient for analysis in many fields. In addition, the heterogeneity of the size of the geographical units causes great distortions in analysis, i.e. the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP). Dasymetric mapping techniques have long been applied world-wide to derive finer (and MAUP-free) depictions of the population distribution. These techniques disaggregate population figures reported at coarse source zones into a finer set of zones using ancillary geographical data. Previous attempts to map the European population at high resolution have used CORINE Land Cover (CLC) as the main source of ancillary data. In this article, we test new geographical datasets to produce an updated and improved European population grid map. It is tested whether using more detailed ancillary data in the dasymetric mapping significantly yields higher accuracies. As final outcome of this cartographic exercise, a European population grid map for the reference year of 2006, with a spatial resolution of 100 × 100 meters, is presented and validated against reference data. Resident population reported at commune level, a refined version of CLC and information on the soil sealing degree are used as the main inputs to produce the final map.},

  abstract = {Sea level rise contribution from the Antarctic ice sheet is influenced by changes in glacier and ice shelf front position. Still, little is known about seasonal glacier and ice shelf front fluctuations as the manual delineation of calving fronts from remote sensing imagery is very time-consuming. The major challenge of automatic calving front extraction is the low contrast between floating glacier and ice shelf fronts and the surrounding sea ice. Additionally, in previous decades, remote sensing imagery over the often cloud-covered Antarctic coastline was limited. Nowadays, an abundance of Sentinel-1 imagery over the Antarctic coastline exists and could be used for tracking glacier and ice shelf front movement. To exploit the available Sentinel-1 data, we developed a processing chain allowing automatic extraction of the Antarctic coastline from Seninel-1 imagery and the creation of dense time series to assess calving front change. The core of the proposed workflow is a modified version of the deep learning architecture U-Net. This convolutional neural network (CNN) performs a semantic segmentation on dual-pol Sentinel-1 data and the Antarctic TanDEM-X digital elevation model (DEM). The proposed method is tested for four training and test areas along the Antarctic coastline. The automatically extracted fronts deviate on average 78 m in training and 108 m test areas. Spatial and temporal transferability is demonstrated on an automatically extracted 15-month time series along the Getz Ice Shelf. Between May 2017 and July 2018, the fronts along the Getz Ice Shelf show mostly an advancing tendency with the fastest moving front of DeVicq Glacier with 726 \&plusmn; 20 m/yr.},

Hazards in the coastal environment, such as coastal storms and erosion, pose significant threats to coastal physical, economic, and social systems. The theory of vulnerability has been an evolving idea over the past hundred years. In recent decades, improved technology and high-profile disaster events, has caused an increase in publications in the coastal hazards field. Modern approaches to understanding coastal vulnerability examine the complex systems that determine the spatial distribution of hazards, risks, and exposure. Consensus among today’s researchers shows that coastal vulnerability is geographically dependent and requires place based investigations. This review examines over 200 coastal vulnerability related works. Through this extensive literature review, this research describes the evolution of vulnerability concepts, and the modern definition of vulnerability with the goal of providing a well-informed body of knowledge to be used in the advancement of resilience and increased sustainability in coastal areas.},

  abstract = {Accurate, robust and consistent coastline mapping is critical for characterising and managing coastal change. Satellite earth observation provides an unparalleled source of freely available data for studying dynamic coastlines through time and across large spatial extents. However, previous satellite-derived shoreline mapping approaches have been challenged by two key limitations: the medium spatial resolution of freely available satellite data, and the confounding influence of tides that can obscure longer term patterns of coastal change. In this study we present Digital Earth Australia Coastlines, a new continental dataset documenting three decades of coastal change across Australia. We combine sub-pixel waterline extraction with a new pixel-based tidal modelling method to seamlessly map almost 2 million km of tide-datum shorelines along the entire Australian coast from 1988 to 2019. Our tidally-constrained median composite approach maps the dominant annual position of the shoreline at 0 m Above Mean Sea Level each year, suppressing the short-term influence of tides and sub-annual shoreline variability. Using this robust mid-term shoreline proxy, long-term coastal change rates spanning the last three decades were accurately quantified and mapped at the continental scale. We find that 22\% of Australia's non-rocky coastline has retreated or grown significantly since 1988, with 16\% changing at greater than 0.5 m per year. Although trends of retreat and growth were closely balanced across the Australian continent, our results highlight significant regional variability and extreme local hotspots of coastal change. Our findings provide new insights into patterns and trends of coastal change across Australia, and highlight advantages and limitations of tide modelling and composite-based methods for extracting consistent shoreline data and long-term coastal trends from earth observation data at continental scale. Digital Earth Australia Coastlines is made available to the public as free and open interactive tools and code to support future coastal research and management across Australia, and any coastal region globally with access to free and open medium resolution satellite data.},

  abstract = {Accurately mapping the boundary between land and water (the \&lsquo;waterline\&rsquo;) is critical for tracking change in vulnerable coastal zones, and managing increasingly threatened water resources. Previous studies have largely relied on mapping waterlines at the pixel scale, or employed computationally intensive sub-pixel waterline extraction methods that are impractical to implement at scale. There is a pressing need for operational methods for extracting information from freely available medium resolution satellite imagery at spatial scales relevant to coastal and environmental management. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of a promising method for mapping waterlines at sub-pixel accuracy from satellite remote sensing data. By combining a synthetic landscape approach with high resolution WorldView-2 satellite imagery, it was possible to rapidly assess the performance of the method across multiple coastal environments with contrasting spectral characteristics (sandy beaches, artificial shorelines, rocky shorelines, wetland vegetation and tidal mudflats), and under a range of water indices (Normalised Difference Water Index, Modified Normalised Difference Water Index, and the Automated Water Extraction Index) and thresholding approaches (optimal, zero and automated Otsu\&rsquo;s method). The sub-pixel extraction method shows a strong ability to reproduce both absolute waterline positions and relative shape at a resolution that far exceeds that of traditional whole-pixel methods, particularly in environments without extreme contrast between the water and land (e.g., accuracies of up to 1.50\&ndash;3.28 m at 30 m Landsat resolution using optimal water index thresholds). We discuss key challenges and limitations associated with selecting appropriate water indices and thresholds for sub-pixel waterline extraction, and suggest future directions for improving the accuracy and reliability of extracted waterlines. The sub-pixel waterline extraction method has a low computational overhead and is made available as an open-source tool, making it suitable for operational continental-scale or full time-depth analyses aimed at accurately mapping and monitoring dynamic waterlines through time and space.},

  abstract = {Analysis of shoreline variability and shoreline erosion-accretion trends is fundamental to a broad range of investigations undertaken by coastal scientists, coastal engineers, and coastal managers. Though strictly defined as the intersection of water and land surfaces, for practical purposes, the dynamic nature of this boundary and its dependence on the temporal and spatial scale at which it is being considered results in the use of a range of shoreline indicators. These proxies are generally one of two types: either a feature that is visibly discernible in coastal imagery (e.g., high-water line [HWL]) or the intersection of a tidal datum with the coastal profile (e.g., mean high water [MHW]). Recently, a third category of shoreline indicator has begun to be reported in the literature, based on the application of image-processing techniques to extract proxy shoreline features from digital coastal images that are not necessarily visible to the human eye. Potential data sources for shoreline investigation include historical photographs, coastal maps and charts, aerial photography, beach surveys, in situ geographic positioning system shorelines, and a range of digital elevation or image data derived from remote sensing platforms. The identification of a “shoreline” involves two stages: the first requires the selection and definition of a shoreline indicator feature, and the second is the detection of the chosen shoreline feature within the available data source. To date, the most common shoreline detection technique has been subjective visual interpretation. Recent photogrammetry, topographic data collection, and digital image-processing techniques now make it possible for the coastal investigator to use objective shoreline detection methods. The remaining challenge is to improve the quantitative and process-based understanding of these shoreline indicator features and their spatial relationship relative to the physical land–water boundary.},

  abstract = {The evolution of coastal and transitional environments depends upon the interplay of human activities and natural drivers, two factors that are strongly connected and many times conflicting. The urge for efficient tools for characterising and predicting the behaviour of such systems is nowadays particularly pressing, especially under the effects of a changing climate, and requires a deeper understanding of the connections among different drivers and different scales. To this aim, the present paper reviews the results of a set of interdisciplinary and coordinated experiences carried out in the Adriatic Sea (north-eastern Mediterranean region), discussing state-of-the art methods for coastal dynamics assessment and monitoring, and suggests strategies towards a more efficient coastal management. Coupled with detailed geomorphological information, the methodologies currently available for evaluating the different components of relative sea level rise facilitate a first identification of the flooding hazard in coastal areas, providing a fundamental element for the prioritization and identification of the sustainability of possible interventions and policies. In addition, hydro- and morpho-dynamic models are achieving significant advances in terms of spatial resolution and physical insight, also in a climatological context, improving the description of the interactions between meteooceanographic processes at the regional scale to coastal dynamics at the local scale. We point out that a coordinated use of the described tools should be promptly promoted in the design of survey and monitoring activities as well as in the exploitation of already collected data. Moreover, expected benefits from this strategy include the production of services and infrastructures for coastal protection with a focus on short-term forecast and rapid response, enabling the implementation of an event-oriented sampling strategy.},

  abstract = {The formation and dynamics of tidal bores in funnel-shaped estuaries is investigated from both a global tidal wave scaling analysis and new quantitative field observations. We show that tidal bore occurrence in convergent estuaries can be estimated from a dimensionless scaling parameter characterizing the relative intensity of nonlinear friction versus local inertia in the momentum equation. A detailed analysis of tidal bore formation and secondary wave structure is presented from a unique long-term database (observations of more than 200 tides) acquired during four campaigns in the two main French tidal-bore estuaries: the Seine and Gironde/Garonne estuaries. We describe the effect of freshwater discharge on the global tidal wave transformation at the estuarine scale and on local tidal bore occurrence in the upper estuary. Our field data suggest that the tidal bore intensity is mainly governed by the dimensionless tidal range, which characterizes the local tidal wave nonlinearity. We also show that the secondary wavefield associated with tidal bore propagating in natural estuaries differs significantly from those associated to undular bores in rectangular channels. In particular, we observe an abrupt decrease of the whelp steepness when the Froude number goes below 1.1. This secondary field transition can explain why tidal bore occurrence in worldwide estuaries is certainly underestimated.},

  abstract = {This article examines the vulnerability of US coastal counties to erosion by combining a socioeconomic vulnerability index with the US Geological Survey's physically based coastal vulnerability index. The end product is a county-based index of overall coastal place vulnerability. The results indicate that place vulnerability along the coast is highly differentiated and influenced by a range of social, economic, and physical indicators. Regionally, Gulf Coast vulnerability is more of a product of social characteristics rather than physical attributes. The opposite is true of Pacific and Atlantic coastal counties, where physical characteristics are more influential in determining erosion-hazard vulnerability. It is clear that overall vulnerability of coastal counties cannot be determined without the union of social, economic, built-environment, and physical characteristics. Yet the methods for combining these components are not widely used at present by coastal scientists and policy makers, rendering hazards assessments incomplete and mitigation plans untenable for many places.},

This textbook emphasizes these similarities to the benefit of understanding shared processes such as nonlinearities in flow and sediment transport. Some prior knowledge with respect to the dynamics of flow, waves and sediment transport is recommended. The authors would like to track the reach and use of this Open Textbook.

  abstract = {The quality of morphodynamic predictions is generally expressed by an overall grid-point based skill score, which measures the relative accuracy of a morphological prediction over a prediction of zero morphological change, using the mean-squared error (MSE) as the accuracy measure. Through a generic ranking for morphodynamic model predictions, this MSE based skill score (MSESS) aims at making model performance comparable across different prediction situations (geographical locations, forcing conditions, time periods, internal dynamics). The implicit assumptions underlying this approach are that the MSE is an appropriate measure of correspondence for morphological predictions and that the accuracy of the initial bed as the reference correctly reflects the inherent difficulty or ease of prediction situations. This paper presents a thorough analysis of the perception of model skill through the MSE skill score. Using synthetic examples, an example from literature and a long-yearly Delft3D model simulation, we demonstrate that unexpected skill may be reported due to a violation of either of the above assumptions. It is shown that the accuracy of the reference fails to reflect the relative difficulty of prediction situations with a different morphological development prior to the evaluation time (for instance trend, cyclic/seasonal, episodic, speed of the development). We further demonstrate that the MSESS tends to favor model results that underestimate the variance of cumulative bed changes, a feature inherited from the MSE. As a consequence of these limitations, the MSESS may report a relative ranking of predictions not matching the intuitive judgment of experts. Guidelines are suggested for how to adjust calibration and validation procedures to be more in line with a morphologist's expert judgment.},

  abstract = {Coastline maintenance in the Netherlands, formally in place since 1990, aims at a sustainable preservation of coastal flood protection. Over 25 years annual assessments, comparing the actual coastline positions with the 1990 reference position of the coastline, have governed the execution of sand nourishments following an adaptive management method. This method involves yearly assessment of the coastline based on measurements, design and adoption of nourishment strategies and measures and execution of the nourishments. This management approach has enabled learning and introduction of innovations in coastline maintenance. For instance, in comparison to the early nineties, nourishments are now placed more on the foreshore and the yearly nourishment budget has doubled. The most recent innovation in coastline maintenance is the ‘Sand Motor’, a nature-based nourishment approach, which concentrates the regular nourishments in space and time, given that natural processes should redistribute the sediment over the wider coastal system. In contrast to regular nourishments, the Sand Motor combines flood protection with nature and recreational objectives and is much larger in dimensions. Five years after the construction of the Sand Motor we investigate its usability in this article. We present the results of first Sand Motor evaluation and draw conclusion on the adoption and usefulness of it for coastline management from the perspective of the adaptive management method used in coastline maintenance. Recent evaluation of the monitoring data shows that the large amount of sand used for the Sand Motor has a positive impact on coastal protection. Bridging between the Sand Motor pilot and daily nourishement practice is however not yet achieved.},

  abstract = {Soft cliff retreat has often triggered a hard adaptation response by the building of seawalls and groynes. On adjacent undefended coasts erosion continues, resulting in set-backs. This paper examines the impact of coastal defences on the adjacent coast from historic records and present practices, and explores possible future response. Continued set-back often leads to outflanking of defences, making them ineffective at their extremities, particularly at the down-drift end where it is most severe. Solutions to outflanking usually involve extending defences, initiating a cycle of set-back, outflanking and further extensions. Multiple defence extensions and continued retreat of the unprotected adjacent coast results in artificial headland formation. Over several decades, headlands experience foreshore steepening and reduced sediment availability, making them more difficult and expensive to defend. Shoreline management plan policies of managed retreat advocate selective defence abandonment, which may change the nature of artificial headland formation. Defence abandonment and new engineering works must be planned, anticipating the processes described in this paper. This will reduce unexpected changes and reduce maintenance and emergency work costs.},

  abstract = {Typology, the ‘study or systematic classification of types that have characteristics or traits in common’, has become a commonly used term and technique in coastal zone studies over the past two decades. At least part of this is due to adoption by the first LandeOcean Interactions in the Coastal Zone (LOICZ) project of a typological approach as a way to understand and organize the daunting diversity of natural and human systems comprising the world coastal zone, and to the concurrent development of tools and databases to support systematic applications. This paper reviews some of the history of the term ‘typology’ and the concepts and techniques that it subsumes, and discusses its adoption and adaptation in coastal studies. It also addresses the continued and increasing relevance of typology to the continuation of the LOICZ project and its objectives, and outlines the opportunities and challenges involved in realizing the potentials of the approach e both within LOICZ and for the scientific and coastal zone communities in general.},

  abstract = {It is a long-standing maxim that coarser sediment sizes are associated with steeper beach-face slopes; but because most work has focused on sandy beaches, few data are available for the pebble, cobble, or boulder size ranges. Little is known, therefore, about how beach morphology and grain size relate at the coarser size grades. We compiled data from the literature—2144 measurements of beach-face slope with associated grain sizes— covering the range from very fine sand to boulders. This meta-analysis shows that beach faces do tend to steepen as average grain size increases, at least up to the cobble size range; but the trend is not simple. Although previous studies suggested a simple power-law relationship between grain size and beach-face slope, in fact the data distribution is best fit by a curve that is steep at the finer grain sizes but is much more gentle as grain size coarsens (and may trend downward for boulders). Fine and medium sands have the greatest range of reported slopes and the data support the importance of effective-weight modification and boundary layer dynamics as primary controls on beach-face steepness at these fine size grades. Around the very coarse sand size grade, a plateau marks a shift in beach dynamics: as hydraulic conductivity increases, beaches switch to being infiltration-dominated. The trend toward steeper slopes continues, but at a lower and steady rate, from granules through cobbles. There appears to be a falloff in slope for the coarsest boulder deposits (but we note that this is based on very few locations, so should be considered preliminary). The overall data distribution is described by a power-law function: tanβ=a(D50−0.125)b+c. The broadness of each transition zone also shows that a range of factors, other than grain size, governs where that tipping point occurs. In the cobble and boulder size ranges there are two deposit categories: boulder beaches, and supratidal boulder ridges. Although not commonly thought of as beaches, boulder ridges record long-term storm deposition and reworking on the highest energy coasts. Supratidal ridges and boulder beaches seem to show different slope/grain-size relationships, with the steepest slopes occurring in boulder ridges, and with boulder beaches showing more gentle gradients than other coarse clastic beaches; but our data set reveals how little quantitative information exists about the coarsest end of the beach spectrum, and invites further work to investigate the sedimentology of cobble- and boulder-dominated systems.},

  abstract = {Coastal areas worldwide represent an aggregation of population and assets of growing economic, geopolitical, and sociocultural significance, yet their functions are increasingly challenged by worsening coastal hazards. Vulnerability assessments have been recognized as one way we can better understand which geographic areas and segments of society are more susceptible to adverse impacts from different stressors or hazards. The aims of this paper are to evaluate the state of coastal vulnerability assessment mapping efforts and to identify opportunities for advancement and refinement that will lead to more cohesive, impactful, and policy-relevant coastal vulnerability studies. We conducted a systematic review of the literature that addresses physical and social vulnerability to coastal hazards and contains corresponding mapping products. The content was analyzed for the scale of analysis, location, disciplinary focus, conceptual framework, metrics used, methodological approach, data sources, mapping output, and policy relevance. Results showed that most Coastal Vulnerability Mapping Assessments (CVMAs) are conducted at the local level using a range of methodologies, often with limited inclusion of social considerations and limited discussion of policy relevance. Based on our analysis, we provide seven recommendations for the advancement of this field that would improve CVMAs’ methodological rigor, policy relevance, and alignment with other vulnerability assessment paradigms.},

  abstract = {The world’s coastlines are spatially highly variable, coupled-human-natural systems that comprise a nested hierarchy of component landforms, ecosystems, and human interventions, each interacting over a range of space and time scales. Understanding and predicting coastline dynamics necessitates frequent observation from imaging sensors on remote sensing platforms. Machine Learning models that carry out supervised (i.e., human-guided) pixel-based classification, or image segmentation, have transformative applications in spatio-temporal mapping of dynamic environments, including transient coastal landforms, sediments, habitats, waterbodies, and water flows. However, these models require large and well-documented training and testing datasets consisting of labeled imagery. We describe “Coast Train,” a multi-labeler dataset of orthomosaic and satellite images of coastal environments and corresponding labels. These data include imagery that are diverse in space and time, and contain 1.2 billion labeled pixels, representing over 3.6 million hectares. We use a human-in-the-loop tool especially designed for rapid and reproducible Earth surface image segmentation. Our approach permits image annotation by multiple labelers, in turn enabling quantification of pixel-level agreement over individual and collections of images.},

However, the general usefulness of deep learning applied to conventional photographic imagery at a landscape scale is, at yet, largely unproven. If DCNN-based image classification is to gain wider application and acceptance within the geoscience community, demonstrable successes need to be coupled with accessible tools to retrain deep neural networks to discriminate landforms and land uses in landscape imagery. Here, we present an efficient approach to train/apply DCNNs with/on sets of photographic images, using a powerful graphical method called a conditional random field (CRF), to generate DCNN training and testing data using minimal manual supervision. We apply the method to several sets of images of natural landscapes, acquired from satellites, aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and fixed camera installations. We synthesize our findings to examine the general effectiveness of transfer learning to landscape-scale image classification. Finally, we show how DCNN predictions on small regions of images might be used in conjunction with a CRF for highly accurate pixel-level classification of images.},

Among modern techniques that use Deep Learning, the UNet architecture has been shown to be a reliable for segmenting a range of imagery. We developed software–Segmentation Gym–to implement a data-model pipeline for segmentation of scientific imagery using a family of UNet models. With an existing set of imagery and labels, the software uses a single configuration file that handles data set creation, as well as model setup and model training. Key benefits of this software are (a) the focus on reproducible data set creation and modeling, and (b) the ability for quick model experimentation through changes to a configuration file. Quick experimentation permits researchers to prototype different model architectures, sizes, and adjust common hyperparameters to find a suitable model. We demonstrate the use of the software using a data set of 419 labeled Landsat-8 scenes of coastal environments and compare results across two model architectures, five model sizes, and three loss functions. This demonstration highlights that our software enables rapid, reproducible experimentation to determine optimal hyperparameters for specific data sets and research questions.},

  abstract = {Mapping bathymetric change is a core task for a wide range of navigation, research, monitoring, and design applications. Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) can support this activity, particularly when using data from a platform, like the Sentinel-2A/B twin mission of the Copernicus programme, which provides routine and repetitive image acquisition at 10 m spatial resolution. As a result, SDB can expand on the temporal and spatial scope of more conventional mapping methods, such as lidar (or multi-beam). In this study, we use SDB, in comparison with high-resolution airborne lidar bathymetry (ALB), to quantify bathymetric changes at two inlets in North Carolina following the impacts of the devastating Hurricane Florence in September 2018. A recently developed multi-temporal SDB model that overcomes problems associated with turbidity and noise effects (whitecaps, ships, cloud shadows, etc.) is used with Sentinel-2 imagery. We identify bathymetric changes in shallow areas with navigation channels in two of the most dynamic inlets in the Outer Banks, Oregon and Hatteras. Multiple lidar surveys are used to validate the SDB method and for an assessment of accuracy and vertical uncertainty. The multi-temporal SDB products and ALB both show similar results in the erosion/accretion patterns. Comparing the change determined from the two methods, gives a median absolute error of \textbackslash textasciitilde0.5 m of SDB compared with ALB, with bias of ±0.2 m for depths ≤7 m; errors that are equivalent to those associated with the SDB estimated absolute depths. The composited SDB yields greater spatial coverage than lidar because it can retrieve data in areas where the lidar mission may have been constrained by turbidity or surf, and also because of the 300-km swath width. The Sentinel-2 constellation provides five-day revisit at the equator (more frequent at higher latitudes), allowing rapid construction of a bathymetric map as well as developing an archive for retrospective analysis. By implementing the multi-temporal turbidity correction, SDB based on Sentinel-2 may substantially enhance existing survey methods for change detection and support operational and recursive coastal monitoring on local to regional scales.},

  abstract = {Sediment grain size is a fundamental parameter conditioning beach-face morphology and shoreline changes. From remote sensing data, an efficient definition of the shoreline position as the water–land interface may allow studying the geomorphological characteristics of the beaches. In this work, shoreline variability is defined by extracting a set of Satellite Derived Shorelines (SDS) covering about three and a half years. SDS are defined from Sentinel 2 imagery with high accuracy (about 3 m RMSE) using SHOREX. The variability is related to a large dataset of grain-size samples from the micro-tidal beaches at the Gulf of Valencia (Western Mediterranean). Both parameters present an inverse and non-linear relationship probably controlled by the beach-face slope. High shoreline variability appears associated with fine sands, followed by a rapid decrease (shifting point about medium/coarse sand) and subsequent small depletions as grain sizes increases. The relationship between both parameters is accurately described by a numerical function (R2 about 0.70) when considering samples at 137 open beaches. The definition of the variability is addressed employing different proxies, coastal segment lengths, and quantity of SDS under diverse oceanographic conditions, allowing to examine the effect they have on the relation with the sediment size. The relationship explored in this work improves the understanding of the mutual connection between sediment size, beach-face slope, and shoreline variability, and it may set up the basis for a rough estimation of sediment grain size from satellite optical imagery.},

Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.Shoreline position data offer extremely valuable information for understanding coastal dynamism and beach changes. This research applies SHOREX system for defining the shoreline position from free mid-resolution Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite imagery. This system allows an automatic definition of Satellite Derived Shorelines (SDS) over large regions and periods. Accuracy and utility of the resulting SDS have been previously assessed with positive results at low energy, microtidal, Mediterranean beaches. This work assesses SDS extracted using SHOREX at a mesotidal and moderate to highly (during storms) energetic environment, namely at Faro Beach, a barrier beach located in Ria Formosa (Algarve, South Portugal). Accuracy was defined for 14 SDS derived from S2 and 10 from L8 by measuring the differences in position with respect to the shoreline inferred from profiles obtained on close dates (or simultaneously) to imagery acquisition. For non-simultaneous datasets, the water level was estimated for the time of the satellite images acquisition using oceanographic data and run-up formulations. The measured and estimated shoreline positions were then compared with the extracted SDS. The overall accuracy is good, with errors about 5 m RMSE, supporting the application of the used methodology to define shoreline dynamics and evolution at challenging environments, as mesotidal exposed and dynamic beaches.},

  abstract = {Forecasting shoreline evolution for sandy coasts is important for sustainable coastal management, given the present-day increasing anthropogenic pressures and a changing future climate. Here, we evaluate eight different time-series forecasting methods for predicting future shorelines derived from historic satellite-derived shorelines. Analyzing more than 37,000 transects around the globe, we find that traditional forecast methods altogether with some of the evaluated probabilistic Machine Learning (ML) time-series forecast algorithms, outperform Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) predictions for the majority of the sites. When forecasting seven years ahead, we find that these algorithms generate better predictions than OLS for 54\% of the transect sites, producing forecasts with, on average, 29\% smaller Mean Squared Error (MSE). Importantly, this advantage is shown to exist over all considered forecast horizons, i.e., from 1 up to 11 years. Although the ML algorithms do not produce significantly better predictions than traditional time-series forecast methods, some proved to be significantly more efficient in terms of computation time. We further provide insight in how these ML algorithms can be improved so that they can be expected to outperform not only OLS regression, but also the traditional time-series forecast methods. These forecasting algorithms can be used by coastal engineers, managers, and scientists to generate future shoreline prediction at a global level and derive conclusions thereof.},

  abstract = {The use of deep learning (DL) approaches for the analysis of remote sensing (RS) data is rapidly increasing. DL techniques have provided excellent results in applications ranging from parameter estimation to image classification and anomaly detection. Although the vast majority of studies report precision indicators, there is a lack of studies dealing with the interpretability of the predictions. This shortcoming hampers a wider adoption of DL approaches by a wider users community, as model’s decisions are not accountable. In applications that involve the management of public budgets or policy compliance, a better interpretability of predictions is strictly required. This work aims to deepen the understanding of a recurrent neural network for land use classification based on Sentinel-2 time series in the context of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). This permits to address the relevance of predictors in the classification process leading to an improved understanding of the behaviour of the network. The conducted analysis demonstrates that the red and near infrared Sentinel-2 bands convey the most useful information. With respect to the temporal information, the features derived from summer acquisitions were the most influential. These results contribute to the understanding of models used for decision making in the CAP to accomplish the European Green Deal (EGD) designed in order to counteract climate change, to protect biodiversity and ecosystems, and to ensure a fair economic return for farmers.},

  abstract = {Insights into the dynamics of coastlines and tidal flats at fine spatial and temporal resolutions are essential for sustainable development. Previous studies were generally conducted at relatively coarse temporal intervals, which hardly captured detailed coastal dynamics, especially in rapidly developing islands. In this study, we developed a new method to map the monthly changes in coastlines and tidal flats in the Zhoushan Archipelago during 1985–2017 using the full time series of Landsat images based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. First, we built the full time series of the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI). Second, we derived temporal segments of MNDWI using a binary segmentation algorithm. Third, we classified the corresponding coastal cover types (i.e., water, tidal flats, and land) for each temporal segment based on the features of MNDWI and regional tidal heights. Finally, we identified the change information including conversion types, and turning years and months. Results indicate that the proposed method can well identify turning years with an overall accuracy of 90\% and map coastal cover types with overall accuracies of 89–94\% in 1985 and 87–92\% in 2017. Significant coastline expansions and declines in tidal flats were found in the study area. The areas of water and tidal flats decreased by 6\% and 10\% during 1985–2017, respectively, while the land area increased by 18\%. The land reclamation was accelerated in the recent decade, and mainly occurred on the medium-large islands, their surrounding small islands, and the islands close to the mainland. The proposed framework based on the GEE platform is transferable to investigate coastal dynamics in other areas. The derived information of changes in coastlines and tidal flats is of great use for sustainable management and ecological studies in coastal areas.},

Results show that the winter-mean wave height, variability, and periodicity all increased significantly in the northeast Atlantic over the last seven decades which primarily correlate with changes in the climate indices North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and West Europe Pressure Anomaly (WEPA) affecting atmospheric circulation in the North Atlantic. NAO and WEPA primarily explain the increase in winter-mean wave height and periodicity, respectively, while both WEPA and NAO explain the increase in interannual variability. This increase in trend, variability, and periodicity resulted in more frequent high-energy winters with high NAO and/or WEPA over the last decades. The ability of climate models to predict the winter NAO and WEPA indices a few months ahead will be crucial to anticipate coastal hazards in this region.},

  abstract = {Abstract Publicly available satellite imagery can now provide multi-decadal time series of shoreline data from local to global scale, enabling analysis of sandy beach shoreline variability across a spectrum of temporal scales. Such data can, however, be associated with large uncertainties, particularly for beaches experiencing a large tidal range (\textbackslash textgreater 2 m) and energetic incident waves. We use a decade of bi-monthly topographic surveys at the high-energy meso-macrotidal beach of Truc Vert, southwest France, and concurrent wave and water-level hindcast to investigate the uncertainties associated with satellite-derived time series of the shoreline position. We show that consideration of the water level and wave runup elevation are critical for accurately estimating waterline position and, in turn, shoreline position. At Truc Vert, including non-tidal water level residuals (e.g. wind-driven surge) and accounting for time- and elevation-varying beach slope for horizontal correction did not improve satellite-derived shoreline position. A new total water level threshold is proposed to maximize the number of usable images while minimizing errors. Accounting for wave runup and the new water level threshold at Truc Vert, the number of usable satellite images is doubled and shoreline position errors are at least halved compared to previous work at this site. Using the 1984–2019 reconstructed shoreline, we also show that the satellite-derived shoreline trends and interannual variability are in better agreement with field measurements. Although the approach proposed here needs to be tested on other sites in different tidal/wave forcing environments with different morphological and sediment characteristics, we anticipate that it will improve the temporal and spatial description of shoreline change on most surf tidal beaches where accurate continuous water level and wave hindcasts and/or observations are available.},

  abstract = {Global warming in response to accumulation of human-induced greenhouse gases inside the atmosphere has already caused several visible consequences, among them increase of the Earth's mean temperature and ocean heat content, melting of glaciers, and loss of ice from the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets. Ocean warming and land ice melt in turn are causing sea level to rise. Sea level rise and its impacts on coastal zones have become a question of growing interest in the scientific community, as well as in the media and public. In this review paper, we summarize the most up-to-date knowledge about sea level rise and its causes, highlighting the regional variability that superimposes the global mean rise. We also present sea level projections for the 21st century under different warming scenarios. We next address the issue of the sea level rise impacts. We question whether there is already observational evidence of coastal impacts of sea level rise and highlight the fact that results differ from one location to another. This suggests that the response of coastal systems to sea level rise is highly dependent on local natural and human settings. We finally show that in spite of remaining uncertainties about future sea levels and related impacts, it becomes possible to provide preliminary assessment of regional impacts of sea level rise.},

  abstract = {Sea level contributions from the Greenland Ice Sheet are influenced by the rapid changes in glacial terminus positions. The documentation of these evolving calving front positions, for which satellite imagery forms the basis, is therefore important. However, the manual delineation of these calving fronts is time consuming, which limits the availability of these data across a wide spatial and temporal range. Automated methods face challenges that include the handling of clouds, illumination differences, sea ice mélange, and Landsat 7 scan line corrector errors. To address these needs, we develop the Calving Front Machine (CALFIN), an automated method for extracting calving fronts from satellite images of marine-terminating glaciers, using neural networks. The results are often indistinguishable from manually curated fronts, deviating by on average 86.76 ± 1.43 m from the measured front. Landsat imagery from 1972 to 2019 is used to generate 22 678 calving front lines across 66 Greenlandic glaciers. This improves on the state of the art in terms of the spatiotemporal coverage and accuracy of its outputs and is validated through a comprehensive intercomparison with existing studies. The current implementation offers a new opportunity to explore subseasonal and regional trends on the extent of Greenland’s margins and supplies new constraints for simulations of the evolution of the mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet and its contributions to future sea level rise.},

  abstract = {This chapter assesses the current state of knowledge of the rate of change of global-averaged and regional sea-level in relation to climate change. We focus on the 20th and 21st centuries.However, because of the slow response to past conditions of the oceans and ice sheets and the consequent land movements, we consider changes in sea level prior to the historical record, andwe also look over a thousand years into the future.Past changes in sea levelFrom recent analyses, our conclusions are as follows:since the Last Glacial Maximum about 20 000 years ago, sea level has risen by over 120 m at locations far from present and former ice sheets, as a result of loss of mass from these ice sheets. There was a rapid rise between 15 000 and 6000 years ago at an average rate of 10 mm/yr.based on geological data, global average sea level may have risen at an average rate of 0.5 mm/yr over the last 6000 years and at an average rate of 0.1 to 0.2 mm/yr over the last 3000 years.vertical land movements are still occurring today as a result of these large transfers of mass from the ice sheets to the ocean.during the last 6000 years, global average sea-level variations on the time scales of a few hundred years and longer are likely to have been less than 0.3 to 0.5 m.based on tide gauge data, the rate of global average sea-level rise during the 20th century is in the range 1.0 to 2.0 mm/yr, with a central value of 1.5 mm/yr (as with other ranges of uncertainty, it is not implied that the central value is the best estimate).based on the few very long tide-gauge records, the average rate of sea-level rise has been larger during the 20th century than the 19th century.no significant acceleration in the rate of sea-level rise during the 20th century has been detected.there is decadal variability in extreme sea levels but no evidence of widespread increases in extremes other than that associated with a change in the mean.Factors affecting present day sea level changeGlobal average sea level is affected by many factors. Our assessment of the most important is as follows.Ocean thermal expansion leads to an increase in ocean volume at constant mass. Observational estimates of about 1 mm/yr over recent decades are similar to values of 0.7 to 1.1 mm/yr obtained from Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) over a comparable period. Averaged over the 20th century, AOGCM simulations result in rates of thermal expansion of 0.3 to 0.7 mm/yr.The mass of the ocean, and thus sea level, changes as water is exchanged with glaciers and ice caps. Observational and modelling studies of glaciers and ice-caps indicate a contribution to sea-level rise of 0.2 to 0.4 mm/yr averaged over the 20th century.Climate changes during the 20th century are estimated from modelling studies to have led to contributions of between Ð0.2 and 0.0 mm/yr from Antarctica (the results of increasing precipitation) and 0.0 to 0.1 mm/yr from Greenland (from changes in both precipitation and runoff).Greenland and Antarctica have contributed 0.0 to 0.5 mm/yr over the 20th century as a result of long term adjustment to past climate changes.Changes in terrestrial storage of water over the period 1910 to 1990 are estimated to have contributed from Ð1.1 to +0.4 mm/yr of sea-level rise.The sum of these components indicates a rate of eustatic sea-level rise (corresponding to a change in ocean volume) from 1910 to 1990 ranging from Ð0.8 mm/yr to 2.2 mm/yr, with a central value of 0.7 mm/yr. The upper bound is close to the observational upper bound (2.0 mm/yr), but the central value bound is less than the observational lower bound (1.0 mm/yr), i.e. the sum of components is biased low compared to the observational estimates. The sum of components indicates an acceleration of only 0.2 mm/yr/century, with a range from Ð1.1 to +0.7 mm/yr/century, consistent with observational finding of no acceleration in sea-level rise during the 20th century. The estimated rate of sea-level rise from anthropogenic climate change from 1910 to 1990 (from modelling studies of thermal expansion, glaciers and ice-sheets) ranges from 0.3 to 0.8 mm/yr. It is very likely that 20th century warming has contributed significantly to the observed sea level rise, through thermal expansion of sea water and widespread loss of land ice.Projected sea-level changes from 1990 to 2100Projections of components contributing to sea-level change from 1990 to 2100 (this period is chosen for consistency with the IPCC Second Assessment Report), using a range of AOGCMs following the IS92a scenario (including the direct effect of sulphate aerosol emissions) give:thermal expansion of 0.11 to 0.43 m, accelerating through the 21st century.a glacier contribution of 0.01 to 0.23 m.a Greenland contribution of -0.02 to 0.09 m.an Antarctic contribution of -0.17 to 0.02 m.Including thawing of permafrost, deposition of sediment, and the ongoing contributions from ice sheets as a result of climate change since the Last Glacial Maximum, we obtain a range of global-average sea-level rise from 0.11 to 0.77 m. This range reflects systematic uncertainties in modelling.For the 35 SRES scenarios, we project a sea-level rise of 0.09 to 0.88 m for 1990 to 2100, with a central value of 0.48 m. The central value gives an average rate of 2.2 to 4.4 times the rate over the 20th century. If terrestrial storage continued at its present rates, the projections could be changed by -0.21 to 0.11 m. For an average AOGCM, the SRES scenarios give results which differ by 0.02 m or less for the first half of the 21st century. By 2100, they vary over a range amounting to about 50\% of the central value. Beyond the 21st century, sea level rise will depend strongly on the emission scenario.The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) has attracted special attention because it contains enough ice to raise sea level by 6 m and because of suggestions that instabilities associated with its being grounded below sea level may result in rapid ice discharge when the surrounding ice shelves are weakened. The range of projections given above makes no allowance for ice-dynamic instability of the WAIS. It is now widely agreed that major loss of grounded ice and accelerated sea-level rise are very unlikely during the 21st century.Our confidence in the regional distribution of sea level change from AOGCMs is low because there is little similarity between models. However, models agree on the qualitative conclusion that the range of regional variation is substantial compared with the global average sea-level rise. Nearly all models project greater than average rise in the Arctic Ocean and less than average rise in the Southern Ocean.Land movements, both isostatic and tectonic, will continue through the 21st century at rates which are unaffected by climate change. It can be expected that by 2100 many regions currently experiencing relative sea-level fall will instead have a rising relative sea level.Extreme high water levels will occur with increasing frequency (i.e. with reducing return period) as a result of mean sea-level rise. Their frequency may be further increased if storms become more frequent or severe as a result of climate change.Longer term changesIf greenhouse gas concentrations were stabilised, sea level would nonetheless continue to rise for hundreds of years. After 500 years, sea-level rise from thermal expansion may have reached only half of its eventual level, which models suggest may lie within ranges of 0.5 to 2.0 m and 1 to 4 m for CO2 levels twice and four times pre-industrial, respectively.Glacier retreat will continue and the loss of a substantial fraction of the total glacier mass is likely. Areas that are currently marginally glaciated are most likely to become ice-free.Ice sheets will continue to react to climate change during the next several thousand years even if the climate is stabilised. Models project that a local annual-average warming of larger than 3°C sustained for millennia would lead to virtually a complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet. For a warming over Greenland of 5.5°C, consistent with mid-range stabilisation scenarios, theGreenland ice sheet contributes about 3 m in 1000 years. For a warming of 8°C, the contribution is about 6 m, the ice sheet being largely eliminated. For smaller warmings, the decay of the ice sheet would be substantially slower.Current ice dynamic models project that the WAIS will contribute no more than 3 mm/yr to sea-level rise over the next thousand years, even if significant changes were to occur in the ice shelves. However, we note that its dynamics are still inadequately understood to make firm projections, especially on the longer time scales.Apart from the possibility of an internal ice dynamic instability, surface melting will affect the long-term viability of the Antarctic ice sheet. For warmings of more than 10°C, simple runoff models predict that an ablation zone would develop on the ice sheet surface. Irreversible disintegration of the WAIS would result because the WAIS cannot retreat to higher ground once its margins are subjected to surface melting and begin to recede. Such a disintegration would take at least a few millennia. Thresholds for total disintegration of the East Antarctic ice sheet by surface melting involve warmings above 20*C, a situation that has not occurred for at least 15 million years and which is far more than predicted by any scenario of climate change currently under consideration.},

  abstract = {We estimate the rise in global average sea level from satellite altimeter data for 1993–2009 and from coastal and island sea-level measurements from 1880 to 2009. For 1993–2009 and after correcting for glacial isostatic adjustment, the estimated rate of rise is 3.2~±~0.4~mm~year−1 from the satellite data and 2.8~±~0.8~mm~year−1 from the in situ data. The global average sea-level rise from 1880 to 2009 is about 210~mm. The linear trend from 1900 to 2009 is 1.7~±~0.2~mm~year−1 and since 1961 is 1.9~±~0.4~mm~year−1. There is considerable variability in the rate of rise during the twentieth century but there has been a statistically significant acceleration since 1880 and 1900 of 0.009~±~0.003~mm~year−2 and 0.009~±~0.004~mm~year−2, respectively. Since the start of the altimeter record in 1993, global average sea level rose at a rate near the upper end of the sea level projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Third and Fourth Assessment Reports. However, the reconstruction indicates there was little net change in sea level from 1990 to 1993, most likely as a result of the volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991.},

The focus on this 250-year window, however, obscures some of the most profound problems associated with climate change. Here, we argue that the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, a period during which the overwhelming majority of human-caused carbon emissions are likely to occur, need to be placed into a long-term context that includes the past 20 millennia, when the last Ice Age ended and human civilization developed, and the next ten millennia, over which time the projected impacts of anthropogenic climate change will grow and persist. This long-term perspective illustrates that policy decisions made in the next few years to decades will have profound impacts on global climate, ecosystems and human societies — not just for this century, but for the next ten millennia and beyond.},

  abstract = {Among cartographic generalisation problems, the generalisation of sinuous bends in mountain roads has always been a popular one due to its difficulty. Recent research showed the potential of deep learning techniques to overcome some remaining research problems regarding the automation of cartographic generalisation. This paper explores this potential on the popular mountain road generalisation problem, which requires smoothing the road, enlarging the bend summits, and schematising the bend series by removing some of the bends. We modelled the mountain road generalisation as a deep learning problem by generating an image from input vector road data, and tried to generate it as an output of the model a new image of the generalised roads. Similarly to previous studies on building generalisation, we used a U-Net architecture to generate the generalised image from the ungeneralised image. The deep learning model was trained and evaluated on a dataset composed of roads in the Alps extracted from IGN (the French national mapping agency) maps at 1:250,000 (output) and 1:25,000 (input) scale. The results are encouraging as the output image looks like a generalised version of the roads and the accuracy of pixel segmentation is around 65\%. The model learns how to smooth the output roads, and that it needs to displace and enlarge symbols but does not always correctly achieve these operations. This article shows the ability of deep learning to understand and manage the geographic information for generalisation, but also highlights challenges to come.},

  abstract = {Quantitative simulation of large-scale coastal behaviour (LSCB) is possible using a model based only on principles of sand-mass conservation and geometric rules for shoreface and active sand-body morphology. Dynamic processes are subsumed into a set of parameters that define the geometry of the active cross-shore profile which in turn can represent an entire coastal cell. The parameters, together with a set of local behaviour rules governing adjustments at discrete points along the profile, provide a simple formulation that is constrained by sediment mass balance to yield emergent, numerical solutions for profile kinematics. The emergent qualities of this shoreface-translation model are exemplified in simulation experiments on changes to sand deposits on the southeastern Australian coast and shelf during the post-glacial marine transgression. In another example, the model is used to simulate LSCB over engineering time scales at an idiosyncratic site. Both examples illustrate the over-riding importance of small residual sand movements that accumulate through time to cause LSCB. In comparison to gross sand movements, the residuals are too small to measure directly or predict on the basis of available theory. Exploratory (inverse) simulation provides a quantitative method for side stepping these limitations. The shoreface-translation model therefore is used as a tool to explore possible forms of coastal behaviour through an approach that incorporates available data along with theoretical considerations. Validation is not strictly possible for this type of inverse approach, so the degree to which a simulation reproduces observed features in nature is a measure of its success.},

In particular, it addresses the use of advanced DInSAR (A-DInSAR) techniques, which are based on large sets of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Copernicus Sentinel-1 images. Such techniques have undergone a dramatic development in the last twenty years: they are now capable to process big sets of SAR images and can be exploited to realize a wide-area A-DInSAR monitoring. The study describes several initiatives to establish wide-area ground motion services (GMS), both at county- and region-level. In the second part of the study, some of the key technical aspects related to wide-area A-DInSAR monitoring are discussed. Finally, the last part of the study is devoted to the European ground motion service (EGMS), which is part of the Copernicus land monitoring service. It represents the most important wide-area A-DInSAR deformation monitoring system ever developed. The study describes its main characteristics and its main products. The end of the production of the first EGMS baseline product is foreseen for the last quarter of 2021.},

  abstract = {The United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is assessing technical methodologies and procedures for the collection, analysis, and computation of coastal erosion rates. This assessment is being performed to determine the feasibility of generating such data for use as a basis for administering Section 544 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (commonly known as the Upton-Jones amendment to the National Flood Insurance Program). It is likely that the methodology selected will involve the use of historical shoreline data compared with current shoreline information. This fundamental approach of predicting shoreline location based on extrapolation of past changes has been utilized by several states in developing data to support setback programs. Requirements contemplated for data development include: (1) standardization of a methodology for developing erosion rate data, (2) consistency in application, (3) capability of being applied in a timely manner, and (4) accuracy commensurate with program needs. This paper largely addresses the last issue by examining sources of errors inherent in the raw data. Source data include historical and recent National Ocean Service (NOS) T-sheets (produced ca. 1840's to present) and air photos (taken ca. late 1930's to present) as well as any other types of accurate map and photographic data. A study of this nature requires extensive preparation of the required source material prior to digitization. For example, the high water line (HWL) or bluff line must be identified and annotated on the air photos and maps. Furthermore, the source material must undergo extensive pre-digitization and post-data compilation accuracy checks and reliability assessments necessary to screen inaccurate maps and air photos. For example, older historical maps with obsolete coordinates must be updated to current standards and analyzed to insure that distortion has not rendered the map inaccurate and unusable. In addition, computerized techniques (e.g., Metric Mapping, analytical stereoplotter) or manual techniques (e.g., Zoom Transfer Scope) must be used to correct for distortion inherent in aerial photography.},

Nowadays, the integration of deep learning in remote sensing and GIS analysis can quickly classify and detect different characteristics on both land and sea. Therefore, the authors proposed the use of a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) for coastal classification based on these technologies and geomorphic profile graphs. The primary input data is digital elevation/depth models obtained from ALOS and NOAA satellite. Eight hundred coastal samples representing eight types of coasts taken along the coastline in Vietnam were used for training and testing various ConvNets. As a result, three ConvNet models using three different optimizer functions were developed with the accuracies of about 98\% and low values of the loss function. These models were used to classify 1029 in 1150 coasts (equal to 89\%) in Vietnam. Nearly 11\% of Vietnamese coasts could not be defined by three ConvNet models due to their complex geomorphic profile graphs, and require assessments of other natural components. The trained ConvNet models can potentially update new coastal types in different tropical countries towards coastal classification on national and global scales.},

Equilibrium-based shoreline models have been shown to skillfully predict short-term wave-driven shoreline change on time scales of hours to decades. Both the Bruun Rule and equilibrium shoreline models rely on the equilibrium beach theory, which states that the beach profile shape equilibrates with its local wave and sea-level conditions. Integrating these two models into a unified framework can improve our understanding and predictive skill of future shoreline behavior. However, given that both models account for wave action, but over different time scales, a critical re-examination of the SLR-driven recession process is needed. We present a novel physical interpretation of the beach response to sea-level rise, identifying two main contributing processes: passive flooding and increased wave-driven erosion efficiency. Using this new concept, we analyze the integration of SLR-driven recession into equilibrium shoreline models and, with an idealized test case, show that the physical mechanisms underpinning the Bruun Rule are explicitly described within our integrated model. Finally, we discuss the possible advantages of integrating SLR-driven recession models within equilibrium-based models with dynamic feedbacks and the broader implications for coupling with hybrid shoreline models.},

Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.The coastal zone is a dynamic area which can experience substantial natural change in short time periods, but changes are also associated with human modifications to the coastline. This case study is focused around assessing shoreline change associated with the Cape Jaffa Marina and canal estate in South Australia. The research comprises a GIS based analysis of shoreline change utilising aerial imagery from 1975 to 2005, which provides information of the morphological coastal trends prior to construction in 2008 of the marina/canal estate. In addition, imagery collected by the RapidEye satellite constellation was used to assess shoreline changes in the decade since construction, 2009 to 2019. The shoreline change statistics over the past few decades were calculated using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System extension of ESRI's ArcGIS. The image analysis workflow is based on the objective extraction of shoreline proxies from individual image statistics in a semi-automated process and is used to identify the waterline and edge of vegetation shoreline proxies in a time series analysis. The results provide a case study of a historically progradational sandy coastline experiencing substantial amounts of alongshore sediment transport, the corresponding obstruction from coastal infrastructure, and the resulting morphological changes to the Cape Jaffa shoreline. Shoreline change trends were altered from a predominantly accretional shoreline before the construction of the marina to one oscillating between extremes of erosion and accretion. The results showed significant accretion occurring updrift (Net Shore Movement (NSM) of 106 m) and significant erosion downdrift (NSM of –80 m) of the marina's training walls and entrance. The information derived from Earth observation satellites, such as RapidEye, can provide valuable insights into trend analysis due to their relatively high spatial (5 metre) and temporal resolution (5.5-day revisit).},

  abstract = {Coastal tourism started in the 19th Century and has increased in non-linear fashion ever since, stimulated by a combination of developments in transport technology and rising prosperity. Initially, mainly national in character, the introduction of roll-on, roll-off ferries and inexpensive air transport caused an exponential 28-fold rise in international tourism between 1950 and the start of the 21st Century. This review considers the impact of tourism at two levels: (1) that created by the sheer numbers of tourists and their demands (‘mass tourism and transport’) and (2) that resulting from individual, often novel, forms of transport (‘personal leisure transport’). Under (1), the consequences of the construction of coastal resorts and roads, marinas and jetties for habitat fragmentation and reduced biodiversity are described. Next, the effects of large cruise ships (now some 250 in number) are considered, particularly in relation to unregulated pollution and the delivery of substantial numbers of tourists to remote destinations. Thirdly, the literature related to disturbance caused by intertidal trampling by tourists on rocky/sandy shores is reviewed, followed by a section devoted to the unappreciated effects of beach ‘cleaning’ (i.e. removal of natural strandlines as well as litter) that is practiced throughout the world's sandy beach resorts. Finally, the potentially positive area of coastal ecotourism is considered, but evidence is assembled to highlight the problems associated with too high a demand. Under (2), the impact of a range of personal leisure transport modes is considered. These range from relatively innocuous pursuits (e.g. swimming, surfing, sailboarding and dinghy sailing), to an extremely popular sport (SCUBA diving) that is marketed for its environmentally-friendly nature, yet causes measurable deterioration in the world's coral ecosystems despite good management practices. The impact of motorboats is considered, particularly in the context of transmission of non-native species, while the highly polluting and disturbing technology of ‘personal watercraft’ is evaluated. Finally, the uncontrolled emergence of new ‘extreme sports’ (e.g. ‘coasteering’, kitesurfing) is identified as a future problem.},

  abstract = {Over the past 40 years, consideration of the potential effect of sea level rise on sandy coasts has been dominated by the conceptual model proposed in the Bruun Rule, which is used to predict the horizontal translation of the shoreline associated with a given rise in sea level. A review of the hypotheses that form the basis for this two-dimensional model suggests that the assumption of net sand transfer to the nearshore profile and deposition of a thickness of sediment equal to the rise in sea level is probably incorrect. Moreover, the model omits consideration of a significant component of the coastal sediment budget, namely the dune sediment budget, and the processes associated with beach-dune interaction. An alternative conceptual model is developed on the basis of a two-dimensional equilibrium profile similar to that which forms the basis for the Bruun Model. The proposed model incorporates consideration of the dune sediment budget and foredune dynamics. In contrast to the Bruun Model, it predicts no net transfer of sediment to the nearshore profile and preservation of the foredune through landward migration. It is argued that the model proposed here offers a better starting point for developing more realistic models of shoreline response to sea level rise that incorporate consideration of alongshore sediment transfers and more complex coastal morphology and sediment characteristics. Testing of the validity of the model and its potential use for integrated coastal zone management will require consideration of the volume changes associated with sea level rise on a decadal scale.},

The book is organized in four parts: (1) an overview of coastal engineering, using case studies to illustrate problems; (2) hydrodynamics of the coastal zone, reviewing storm surges, water waves, and low frequency motions within the nearshore and surf zone; (3) coastal responses including equilibrium beach profiles and sediment transport; (4) applications such as erosion mitigation, beach nourishment, coastal armoring, tidal inlets, and shoreline management.},

Users specify the computation in terms of a map and a reduce function, and the underlying runtime system automatically parallelizes the computation across large-scale clusters of machines, handles machine failures, and schedules inter-machine communication to make efficient use of the network and disks. Programmers find the system easy to use: more than ten thousand distinct MapReduce programs have been implemented internally at Google over the past four years, and an average of one hundred thousand MapReduce jobs are executed on Google's clusters every day, processing a total of more than twenty petabytes of data per day.},

In order to develop a basis for predicting future shoreline positions and to interpret shoreline history, substantial efforts have been devoted to the idealization of shoreline behavior and to the formalization of simple models. These models include both kinematic and dynamic elements. The kinematic element requires conservation of sediment and the dynamic element relates the beach shape and/or position to some characteristics of the affecting forces. The kinematic element of a shoreline change model simply ensures conservation of volume of sediment. Usually the dynamic element of a model is coupled in some manner to the change in force that is taking place. The most common type of model attempts to address the changes that occur due to storms due to elevated mean water levels and storm waves or due to long-term sea level rise.},

  abstract = {In Africa, several new seaport developments are being considered. In sedimentary environments, such port developments can have adverse impacts on the evolution of adjacent coastlines. To learn from past port engineering practice, we created a unique database containing the coastline evolution and characteristics of 130 existing African seaports. Whereas the systematic mapping of coastal impacts was previously hampered by data availability, innovative automated satellite image processing techniques have enabled us to intercompare ports at an unprecedented continental scale. We found large geographical differences with respect to the beach evolution. The total detected changes in the beach area between 1984 and 2018 totaled 44 km2, of which ca. 23 km2 is accretion and ca. 21 km2 is erosion. The top 10\% \&ldquo;hotspot\&rdquo; ports account for more than 65\% of these changes. These hotspots exhibit common characteristics, namely: they are located on open coastlines, have large alongshore sediment transport potential, and have large cross-shore breakwaters. Although these driving characteristics are well established in coastal engineering theory, our results indicate that the beaches adjacent to the existing seaports have been and remain seriously affected by these drivers. Our results can be used to inform beach maintenance strategies for existing seaports and to support planners and engineers to minimize long-term coastal impacts of port expansions and new port developments in Africa in the future.},

In both cases the Antarctic ice sheet has been implicated as the primary contributor, hinting at its future vulnerability. Here we use a model coupling ice sheet and climate dynamics—including previously underappreciated processes linking atmospheric warming with hydrofracturing of buttressing ice shelves and structural collapse of marine-terminating ice cliffs—that is calibrated against Pliocene and Last Interglacial sea-level estimates and applied to future greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Antarctica has the potential to contribute more than a metre of sea-level rise by 2100 and more than 15\,metres by 2500, if emissions continue unabated. In this case atmospheric warming will soon become the dominant driver of ice loss, but prolonged ocean warming will delay its recovery for thousands of years.},

  abstract = {We provide a brief synopsis of the unique physical and ecological attributes of sandy beach ecosystems and review the main anthropogenic pressures acting on the world's single largest type of open shoreline. Threats to beaches arise from a range of stressors which span a spectrum of impact scales from localised effects (e.g. trampling) to a truly global reach (e.g. sea-level rise). These pressures act at multiple temporal and spatial scales, translating into ecological impacts that are manifested across several dimensions in time and space so that today almost every beach on every coastline is threatened by human activities. Press disturbances (whatever the impact source involved) are becoming increasingly common, operating on time scales of years to decades. However, long-term data sets that describe either the natural dynamics of beach systems or the human impacts on beaches are scarce and fragmentary. A top priority is to implement long-term field experiments and monitoring programmes that quantify the dynamics of key ecological attributes on sandy beaches. Because of the inertia associated with global climate change and human population growth, no realistic management scenario will alleviate these threats in the short term. The immediate priority is to avoid further development of coastal areas likely to be directly impacted by retreating shorelines. There is also scope for improvement in experimental design to better distinguish natural variability from anthropogenic impacts. Sea-level rise and other effects of global warming are expected to intensify other anthropogenic pressures, and could cause unprecedented ecological impacts. The definition of the relevant scales of analysis, which will vary according to the magnitude of the impact and the organisational level under analysis, and the recognition of a physical–biological coupling at different scales, should be included in approaches to quantify impacts. Zoning strategies and marine reserves, which have not been widely implemented in sandy beaches, could be a key tool for biodiversity conservation and should also facilitate spillover effects into adjacent beach habitats. Setback and zoning strategies need to be enforced through legislation, and all relevant stakeholders should be included in the design, implementation and institutionalisation of these initiatives. New perspectives for rational management of sandy beaches require paradigm shifts, by including not only basic ecosystem principles, but also incentives for effective governance and sharing of management roles between government and local stakeholders.},

In particular, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven very useful in fields such as image recognition; however, the use of CNNs in large-scale remote sensing landcover classifications still needs further investigation. We set out to test CNN-based landcover classification against a more conventional XGBoost shallow learning algorithm for mapping a notoriously difficult group of landcover classes, wetland class as defined by the Canadian Wetland Classification System. We developed two wetland inventory style products for a large (397,958 km2) area in the Boreal Forest region of Alberta, Canada, using Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and ALOS DEM data acquired in Google Earth Engine. We then tested the accuracy of these two products against three validation data sets (two photo-interpreted and one field). The CNN-generated wetland product proved to be more accurate than the shallow learning XGBoost wetland product by 5\%. The overall accuracy of the CNN product was 80.2\% with a mean F1-score of 0.58. We believe that CNNs are better able to capture natural complexities within wetland classes, and thus may be very useful for complex landcover classifications. Overall, this CNN framework shows great promise for generating large-scale wetland inventory data and may prove useful for other landcover mapping applications.},

Globally, rising sea levels, storms and diminishing sand supplies threaten beaches and the recreational, ecosystem, groundwater and flood protection services they provide. Consequently, beach nourishment practices have evolved from focusing on maximizing the time sand stays on the beach to also encompassing human safety and water recreation, groundwater dynamics and ecosystem impacts. In this Perspective, we present a multidisciplinary overview of beach nourishment, discussing physical aspects of beach nourishment alongside ecological and socio-economic impacts. The future of beach nourishment practices will vary depending on local vulnerability, sand availability, financial resources, government regulations and efficiencies, and societal perceptions of environmental risk, recreational uses, ecological conservation and social justice. We recommend co-located, multidisciplinary research studies on the combined impacts of nourishments, and explorations of various designs to guide these globally diverse nourishment practices.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a methodology that is based on the use of relational spatial databases and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), to generate an indicator of sensitivity to erosive processes for dry beaches, which was then applied in the province of Cádiz (Southern Spain). The variables ‘width of dry beach’; ‘accommodation space – width and type of sedimentary substrate’; and ‘mid-term erosion rate’ (1977–2013) are calculated in detail (1:2500). Following this, the accommodation space variable is weighted according to its sedimentary substrate before calculating the sensitivity indicator by aggregating all variables. Results suggest that Mediterranean beaches are more likely to be erosion sensitive than Atlantic ones. Both groups share similar features: similar dry beach width, a tendency to erode, and the existence of little or no accommodation space. Of those beaches in the extremely sensitive bracket, 29\% are located in urban areas, especially common along the Mediterranean facade, where the presence of infrastructure (mainly retaining walls and seaside promenades) prevents both the increase of the beach's potential expansion areas and the oscillation of the shoreline. The methodology developed can be applied to other regions and will be of interest for coastal planners and managers, whom can use this information to understand coastal erosion hazards and to readily identify areas that are less resilient to erosive phenomena and where more detailed analyses should be carried out.},

Model output from a 50-km study region centred on the soft-rock shore of northeast Norfolk was verified through comparison with cliff recession rates that were extracted from historical maps spanning more than a century. Predictions were then made for the period 2000 to 2100 under combined climatic change and management scenarios. For the scenarios evaluated, the model was relatively insensitive to increases in offshore wave height and moderately sensitive to changes in wave direction, but the most important effects were associated with accelerated sea-level rise (SLR). In contrast to predictions made using a modified version of the Bruun rule, the systems model predicted rather complex responses to SLR. For instance, on some sectors of coast, whereas the Bruun rule predicted increased recession under accelerated SLR, the systems model actually predicted progradation owing to the delivery of sediment from eroding coasts up-drift. By contrast, on coasts where beaches are underlain by shore platforms, both the Bruun rule and the systems model predicted accelerated recession rates. However, explicit consideration of the interaction between beach and shore platform within the systems model indicates that these coasts have a broader range of responses and lower overall vulnerability to SLR than predicted by the Bruun rule.},

In addition, wave energy is usually higher than normal under storm conditions so that currents and subsequent sediment transport can induce, dramatic morphological changes, including severe erosion. This chapter presents the main processes that control water level variations and hydrodynamic circulation under storm conditions. It reviews the main mechanisms that control storm surges: atmospheric pressure gradients, surface stress and short-wave dissipation. The chapter explores the mechanisms that drive the hydrodynamic circulation along the coast: longshore currents, bed return flows, infragravity waves and swash dynamics. Storm surges correspond to non-astronomic variations in the ocean free-surface driven by meteo-oceanic forcing. The relationship between the height of the storm surge and the bathymetry is explained through the governing shallow water equations, where the wind effect is inversely proportional to the water depth.},

This chapter discusses the morphodynamics and sedimentologic characteristics of open-coast tidal flats using those along the Changjiang River delta in China as examples. The open-coast tidal flats fringing the Changjiang River delta are significantly influenced by the tremendous mud-sized sediment supplies from the large river. Open-coast tidal flats illustrate a characteristic sequence of sedimentary structures composed of muddy and sandy laminae. A distinctive group with thicker sandy laminae is referred to as Sand-Dominated Layer (SDL), while a group with thicker muddy laminae is referred to as Mud-Dominated Layer (MDL). SDL is deposited during storm season, while MDL corresponds to calm weather season. The alternation of SDL and MDL therefore represents the variation of storm and calm weather season. This understanding is in contrast to the commonly used spring-neap tidal cycle interpretation.},

  abstract = {Summary Coastal cliffs provide some of the most spectacular landscape scenery around the world. This chapter focuses on cliffs from around the United Kingdom, developed in a variety of geological formations, to exemplify the complex and diverse impacts storms can have on cliff responses. It looks at both the impact of individual storms but also stresses the importance of sequences of storms and longer phases of storminess. Spatial variation in cliff retreat is frequently observed along the cliffed coast and recent studies are providing growing evidence for the complex nature of cliff response to storms. The example provided in the chapter illustrates this alongshore variation and suggests that, even for the largest storms, cliff response can be strongly controlled by geological composition and the way it affects the balance between marine and terrestrial processes. Both domains play an important part in determining spatial variation in cliff retreat and combine in different ways.},

It begins with a brief examination of the geomorphic units of reef systems, places the physical dynamics of reefs within an eco-morphodynamic framework and highlights the unique aspects of the interaction of waves and storm waves with reef systems that force ecological and geomorphic change. The focus of the chapter is on the event-scale effects of storm events. Storm effects are considered with respect to both the structure of coral reefs, which is further considered on the different morphological components, and sedimentary landforms. Storm driven effects are placed within the eco-morphodynamic framework that reflects the interaction of biological and physical processes. The chapter also highlights contemporary research questions in understanding the influence of storms on the current dynamics and future trajectories of coral reef structure and associated sedimentary landforms.},

  abstract = {Accurate maps of surface water are essential for many environmental applications. Surface water maps can be generated by combining measurements from multiple sources. Precise estimation of surface water using satellite imagery remains a challenging task due to the sensor limitations, complex land cover, topography, and atmospheric conditions. As a complementary dataset, in the case of hilly landscapes, a drainage network can be extracted from high-resolution digital elevation models. Additionally, Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) initiatives, such as OpenStreetMap, can also be used to produce high-resolution surface water masks. In this study, we derive a high-resolution water mask using Landsat 8 imagery and OpenStreetMap as well as (potential) a drainage network using 30 m SRTM. Our approach to derive a surface water mask from Landsat 8 imagery comprises the use of a lower 15\% percentile of Landsat 8 Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance from 2013 to 2015. We introduce a new non-parametric unsupervised method based on the Canny edge filter and Otsu thresholding to detect water in flat areas. For hilly areas, the method is extended with an additional supervised classification step used to refine the water mask. We applied the method across the Murray-Darling basin, Australia. Differences between our new Landsat-based water mask and the OpenStreetMap water mask regarding positional differences along the rivers and overall coverage were analyzed. Our results show that about 50\% of the OpenStreetMap linear water features can be confirmed using the water mask extracted from Landsat 8 imagery and the drainage network derived from SRTM. We also show that the observed distances between river features derived from OpenStreetMap and Landsat 8 are mostly smaller than 60 m. The differences between the new water mask and SRTM-based linear features and hilly areas are slightly larger (110 m). The overall agreement between OpenStreetMap and Landsat 8 water masks is about 30\%.},

Modeled and observed daily values of mean, minimum and maximum temperature and total precipitation are used to construct transfer functions for the period 1961–1990, which are then applied to the decade 1991–2000, where the results are evaluated. By using a large ensembles of model runs and a long construction period, we take into account both intermodel variability and longer (e.g., decadal) natural climate variability. Results show that the technique performs successfully for all variables over large part of the European continent, for all seasons. In particular, the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of both temperature and precipitation are greatly improved, especially in the tails, i.e., increasing the capability of reproducing extreme events. When the statistics of bias-corrected results are ensemble averaged, the result is very close to the observed ones. The bias correction technique is also able to improve statistics that depend strongly on the temporal sequence of the original field, such as the number of consecutive dry days and the total amount of precipitation in consecutive heavy precipitation episodes, which are quantities that may have a large influence on, e.g., hydrological or crop impact models. Bias-corrected projections of RCMs are hence found to be potentially useful for the assessment of impacts of climate change over Europe.},

  abstract = {Statistical bias-adjustment of climate models' outputs is being increasingly used for assessing the impact of climate change on several sectors. It is known that these techniques may alter the mean climate signal of the adjusted variable; however, the effect on the projected occurrence of climate extremes is less commonly investigated. Here the outputs of an ensemble of high-resolution (0.11°) regional climate models (RCM) from the Coordinated Regional-climate Downscaling Experiment for Europe (EURO-CORDEX) have been bias adjusted, and a number of climate indices from the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices have been calculated for the present (1981–2010) and future (2071–2100) climate. Indices include absolute-thresholds indices, percentile-based indices, and indices based on the duration of an event. Results show that absolute-threshold indices are largely affected by bias adjustment, as they depend strongly on both the present mean climate value (usually largely biased in the original RCMs) and its shift under climate change. The change of percentile-based indices is less affected by bias adjustment, as that of indices based on the duration of an event (e.g., consecutive dry days or heat waves) although the present climate value can differ between original and bias-adjusted results. Indices like R95ptot (the total amount of precipitation larger than the 95th reference percentile) are largely affected by bias adjustment, although, when analyzing an ensemble of RCMs, the differences are usually smaller than, or comparable to, the intermodel variability.},

Robust changes (more than 0.5°C) in maximum temperature affect smaller areas (usually less than 20\%). There is a substantial nonlinear change of fixed-threshold indices, with more than 60\% increase of the number of tropical nights over southern Europe and more than 50\% decrease in the number of frost days over central Europe.

  abstract = {Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is a joint initiative of the European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA), designed to establish a European capacity for the provision and use of operational monitoring information for environment and security applications. ESA's role in GMES is to provide the definition and the development of the space- and ground-related system elements. GMES Sentinel-2 mission provides continuity to services relying on multi-spectral high-resolution optical observations over global terrestrial surfaces. The key mission objectives for Sentinel-2 are: (1) To provide systematic global acquisitions of high-resolution multi-spectral imagery with a high revisit frequency, (2) to provide enhanced continuity of multi-spectral imagery provided by the SPOT (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre) series of satellites, and (3) to provide observations for the next generation of operational products such as land-cover maps, land change detection maps, and geophysical variables. Consequently, Sentinel-2 will directly contribute to the Land Monitoring, Emergency Response, and Security services. The corresponding user requirements have driven the design toward a dependable multi-spectral Earth-observation system featuring the Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) with 13 spectral bands spanning from the visible and the near infrared to the short wave infrared. The spatial resolution varies from 10m to 60m depending on the spectral band with a 290km field of view. This unique combination of high spatial resolution, wide field of view and spectral coverage will represent a major step forward compared to current multi-spectral missions. The mission foresees a series of satellites, each having a 7.25-year lifetime over a 15-year period starting with the launch of Sentinel-2A foreseen in 2013. During full operations two identical satellites will be maintained in the same orbit with a phase delay of 180° providing a revisit time of five days at the equator. This paper provides an overview of the GMES Sentinel-2 mission including a technical system concept overview, image quality, Level 1 data processing and operational applications.},

Such observations are critical for accurately assessing the existing biomass of forests, and how changes in this biomass caused by human activities or variations in climate may impact atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Additionally, the three-dimensional structure of forests is a key component of habitat quality and biodiversity at local to regional scales. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) was launched to the International Space Station in late 2018 to provide high-quality measurements of forest vertical structure in temperate and tropical forests between 51.6  N \& S latitude. The GEDI instrument is a geodetic-class laser altimeter/waveform lidar comprised of 3 lasers that produce 8 transects of structural information. Over its two-year nominal lifetime GEDI is anticipated to provide over 10 billion waveforms at a footprint resolution of 25 m. These data will be used to derive a variety of footprint and gridded products, including canopy height, canopy foliar profiles, Leaf Area Index (LAI), sub-canopy topography and biomass. Additionally, data from GEDI are used to demonstrate the efficacy of its measurements for prognostic ecosystem modeling, habit and biodiversity studies, and for fusion using radar and other remote sensing instruments. GEDI science and technology are unique: no other space-based mission has been created that is specifically optimized for retrieving vegetation vertical structure. As such, GEDI promises to advance our understanding of the importance of canopy vertical variations within an ecological paradigm based on structure, composition and function.},

Large rivers (V) largely bypass the nearshore filter, while karstic (VI) and arheic coasts (VII) act as inactive filters. This typology provides new insight into the spatial distribution and inherent heterogeneity of estuarine filters worldwide. The relative importance of each type at the global scale is calculated and types I, II, III and IV account for 32\%, 22\%, 8\% and 26\% of the global coastline, respectively, while 12\% have a very limited nearshore coastal filter. As an application of this typology, the global estuarine surface area is re-estimated to 1.1×106 km2 instead of 1.4×106 km2 in earlier work.},

  abstract = {Wave breaking is an important process for energy dissipation in the open ocean and coastal seas. It drives beach morphodynamics, controls air-sea interactions, determines when ship and offshore structure operations can occur safely, and influences on the retrieval of ocean properties from satellites. Still, wave breaking lacks a proper physical understanding mainly due to scarce observational field data. Consequently, new methods and data are required to improve our current understanding of this process. In this paper we present a novel machine learning method to detect active wave breaking, that is, waves that are actively generating visible bubble entrainment in video imagery data. The present method is based on classical machine learning and deep learning techniques and is made freely available to the community alongside this publication. The results indicate that our best performing model had a balanced classification accuracy score of \$\$\textbackslash approx\$\$90\% when classifying active wave breaking in the test dataset. An example of a direct application of the method includes a statistical description of geometrical and kinematic properties of breaking waves. We expect that the present method and the associated dataset will be crucial for future research related to wave breaking in several areas of research, which include but are not limited to: improving operational forecast models, developing risk assessment and coastal management tools, and refining the retrieval of remotely sensed ocean properties.},

  abstract = {Optical data from a sun-synchronous satellite were used to investigate how large-scale estuarine suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations were affected by tidal and bulk meteorological drivers, and how retrieved SPM is biased by tidal aliasing and sampling under clear sky conditions. Local absorption and scattering properties were used to derive surface SPM maps from 84 cloud-free ENVISAT MERIS FR reflectance images of the Westerschelde estuary (51° 30′ N, 3° 30′ E) for the period 2006–2008, and validated with in situ SPM at fixed stations (r=0.89 for geometric means). The distinctly different SPM maps were categorized for different tidal and seasonal conditions. Resulting composites reveal spatial patterns in SPM as a function of semi-diurnal tidal phase, fortnightly tidal phase, or season. For the estuary proper, tidal and seasonal effects on the variation of SPM are similar in magnitude. Observed controls for surface SPM are distance to shallow source area, tidal current velocity, and advection of North Sea and estuarine surface waters. Turbidity maxima appear only during favourable tidal and meteorological conditions. For the Westerschelde, the bias introduced by sun-synchronous sampling causes low water image acquisitions to uniquely coincide with spring tides, and high water images with neap tides. Cloud-free images were associated with low wind velocities. Simulations from a mud transport model confirmed the overestimation of geometric mean SPM from the tidal aliasing, and underestimation from fair weather. This resulted in a net relative error of −8\% at the wave-exposed mouth, but biases cancelled out in the upper estuary. We argue that local biases should be considered when interpreting water quality products for estuaries and coasts around the world.},

  abstract = {The future of large-scale coastline evolution will be strongly coupled to human manipulations designed to prevent erosion. We explore the consequences of this coupling using a numerical model for large-scale coastline evolution to compare the long-term, non-local effects of two generalized classes of shoreline stabilization: 1) beach nourishment (the addition of dredged sand to an eroding beach), and 2) hard-structures (e.g., seawalls, groynes, etc.) which fix the position of the shoreline without adding sand. In centurial model experiments where localized stabilization is maintained in the context of changing climate forcing, both forms of stabilization are found to significantly alter patterns of erosion and accretion at distances up to tens of kilometers. On a cuspate-cape coastline similar to the North and South Carolina coast, USA, with stabilization applied to the eroding updrift flank of a single cape, perturbations to coastline evolution are qualitatively similar within ∼20 km for each stabilization scenario, though they differ in magnitude both updrift and downdrift of the stabilized shoreline. The “human” signal in coastline change can extend as far as a neighboring cape (approximately 100 km away), but these long-range effects differ for each scenario. Nourishment resulted in seaward growth of the stabilized cape, increasing the extent that it blocked sediment flux in downdrift regions of the coast through wave shadowing. When stabilized with a hard structure the cape's initial position remain fixed, decreasing wave shadowing.},

Deductive reasoning based on instrumental data such as tide gauges frequently lead to misleading conclusions, in that most are located in the northern hemisphere (land-dominated), near river mouths (variable runoff), sediment compaction, crustal lowering, coriolis effect of geostrophic current variation, and excessively short data spans (\&lt; 100 yr). Climatic oscillation influences sea level on all scales from ENSO (El Niño Southern Oscillation) and NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) up to 1500 yr or more. Satellite observations furnish only the briefest “snap-shots.”Classifications based on perceived “relative” relationships such as submergence or emergence are useful as generalizations, but only when provided with the time scale. Similar constraints apply to subsidence and uplift, and always subject to the three fundamental criteria.},

  abstract = {Classifying surface cover types and analyzing changes are among the most common applications of remote sensing. One of the most basic classification tasks is to distinguish water bodies from dry land surfaces. Landsat imagery is among the most widely used sources of data in remote sensing of water resources; and although several techniques of surface water extraction using Landsat data are described in the literature, their application is constrained by low accuracy in various situations. Besides, with the use of techniques such as single band thresholding and two-band indices, identifying an appropriate threshold yielding the highest possible accuracy is a challenging and time consuming task, as threshold values vary with location and time of image acquisition. The purpose of this study was therefore to devise an index that consistently improves water extraction accuracy in the presence of various sorts of environmental noise and at the same time offers a stable threshold value. Thus we introduced a new Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) improving classification accuracy in areas that include shadow and dark surfaces that other classification methods often fail to classify correctly. We tested the accuracy and robustness of the new method using Landsat 5 TM images of several water bodies in Denmark, Switzerland, Ethiopia, South Africa and New Zealand. Kappa coefficient, omission and commission errors were calculated to evaluate accuracies. The performance of the classifier was compared with that of the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) classifiers. In four out of five test sites, classification accuracy of AWEI was significantly higher than that of MNDWI and ML (P-value{$<$}0.01). AWEI improved accuracy by lessening commission and omission errors by 50\% compared to those resulting from MNDWI and about 25\% compared to ML classifiers. Besides, the new method was shown to have a fairly stable optimal threshold value. Therefore, AWEI can be used for extracting water with high accuracy, especially in mountainous areas where deep shadow caused by the terrain is an important source of classification error.},

Coastal Belt Linked Classification (CBLC): A system for characterizing the interface between land and sea based on large marine ecosystems, coastal ecological sequences, and terrestrial ecoregions. Journal of Coastal Research, 36(4), 677–693. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.The Coastal Belt Linked Classification (CBLC) is a novel approach based on interpretation of satellite images and assimilation of collateral data to characterize coastal belt segments that function as discrete interfaces between land and sea. This method is based on the formulation of concepts derived from the Biophysical Cross-shore Classification System (BCCS), the worldwide and regional-scale Large Marine Ecosystems (LME) classification, and the global distribution of terrestrial Ecoregions (ER). The coastal belt, a zone that extends across the shore from marine environments to inland terrestrial habitats, has recently been described in terms of cross-shore catenary sequences based on biophysical attributes of geomorphology and ecology. The CBLC formulates a cross-shore coastal classification by conjoining the Dominant Catenary Sequences (DCS) and Coastal Ecological Sequences (CES) with marine (LME) and terrestrial (ER) ecological systems; thus, a linkage is now provided between marine and terrestrial areas across coastal belts that function as transitional succession zones. This study proposes to combine the traditionally separated tripartite marine, coastal, and terrestrial delineations by melding them into a single descriptive code sequence that can be ascertained from interpretation of Google Earth satellite imagery and accessing collateral data via interactive LME and ER online platforms. Development of the CBLC is facilitated by the fact that LME and ER units are codified by numerals that are easily added to the formulated CES as prefixes and suffixes. The resulting combined alphanumeric code brings together a trove of information at different levels of investigation (Levels I – IV) that was heretofore not easily assimilated. This linkage of DCS and CES catenas with marine LME and terrestrial ER units brings added advantage to the interpretation of satellite imagery of the world's coasts, as it allows coastal belts to be viewed within the context of transitional interfaces between connected marine and terrestrial parameters. Recognition of coastal belts as interfacial bridges linking terrestrial and marine ecosystems into one codified descriptor sequence allows for cross-shore transects to be defined in the form of the Coastal Belt Linked Classification (CBLC) and provides an opportunity to fully comprehend the dynamic nature of coastal zones around the world.},

  abstract = {Whilst understanding and predicting the effects of coastal change are primarily modelling problems, it is essential that we have appropriate conceptual frameworks for (1) the formalisation of existing knowledge; (2) the formulation of relevant scientific questions and management issues; (3) the implementation and deployment of predictive models; and (4) meaningful engagement involvement of stakeholders. Important progress continues to be made on the modelling front, but our conceptual frameworks have not evolved at a similar pace. Accordingly, this paper presents a new approach that re-engages with formal systems analysis and provides a mesoscale geomorphological context within which the coastal management challenges of the 21st century can be more effectively addressed. Coastal and Estuarine System Mapping (CESM) is founded on an ontology of landforms and human interventions that is partly inspired by the coastal tract concept and its temporal hierarchy of sediment sharing systems, but places greater emphasis on a hierarchy of spatial scales. This extends from coastal regions, through landform complexes, to landforms, the morphological adjustment of which is constrained by diverse forms of human intervention. Crucially, CESM integrates open coastal environments with estuaries and relevant portions of the inner shelf that have previously been treated separately. In contrast to the nesting of littoral cells that has hitherto framed shoreline management planning, CESM charts a complex web of interactions, of which a sub-set of mass transfer pathways defines the sediment budget, and a multitude of human interventions constrains natural landform behaviour. Conducted within a geospatial framework, CESM constitutes a form of knowledge formalisation in which disparate sources of information (published research, imagery, mapping, raw data etc.) are generalised into usable knowledge. The resulting system maps provide a framework for the development and application of predictive models and a repository for the outputs they generate (not least, flux estimates for the major sediment system pathways). They also permit comparative analyses of the relative abundance of landforms and the multi-scale interactions between them. Finally, they articulate scientific understanding of the structure and function of complex geomorphological systems in a way that is transparent and accessible to diverse stakeholder audiences. As our models of mesoscale landform evolution increase in sophistication, CESM provides a platform for a more participatory approach to their application to coastal and estuarine management.},

  abstract = {Coastal management in the Netherlands has the aim to defend coastal zones by preventing flooding and mitigating erosion. To that end, large-scale nourishments are placed in the nearshore, which are supposed to dynamically preserve the coastal zone over a timescale of years. To assess their effectiveness, these nourishments are monitored over large areas and long durations. As repetitive, in-situ measurements become too expensive, remote sensing offers an attractive alternative, mapping depth and near-surface current fields via depth inversion algorithms (DIA). However, the information that can be derived from remotely-sensed data is subject to improvement. In this study a 3D-FFT based DIA named XMFit (X-Band Matlab Fitting) is introduced, which is robust, accurate and fast enough for operational use. Focusing on depth estimates, the algorithm was validated for two case studies in the Netherlands: (1) the “Sand Engine”, a beach mega nourishment at a uniform open coast, and (2) the tidal inlet of the Dutch Wadden Sea island Ameland, characterizing a more complex coast. Considering both sites, the algorithm performance was characterized by a spatially averaged depth bias of −0.9 m at the Sand Engine and a time-varying bias of approximately -2 – 0 m at the Ameland Inlet. When compared to in-situ depth surveys the accuracy was lower, but the time resolution higher. Depth estimates from the Ameland tidal inlet were produced every 50 min by an operational system using a navigational X-Band radar to monitor the placement of a 5 million m3 ebb-tidal delta nourishment – a pilot measure for coastal management. Volumetric changes in the nourishment area over the year 2018, occurring at 7 km distance from the radar, were estimated with an error of 7\%. Depth errors statistically correlated with the direction and magnitude of simultaneous near-surface current estimates. Additional experiments on Sand Engine data demonstrated that depth errors may be significantly reduced using an alternative spectral approach and/or by using a Kalman filter.},

Earth science data are being transformed into new formats optimized for cloud storage that enable rapid analysis of multi-petabyte data sets. Data sets are moving from archive centers to vast cloud data storage, adjacent to massive server farms. Open source cloud-based data science platforms, accessed through a web-browser window, are enabling advanced, collaborative, interdisciplinary science to be performed wherever scientists can connect to the internet. Specialized software and hardware for machine learning and artificial intelligence are being integrated into data science platforms, making them more accessible to average scientists. Increasing amounts of data and computational power in the cloud are unlocking new approaches for data-driven discovery. For the first time, it is truly feasible for scientists to bring their analysis to data in the cloud without specialized cloud computing knowledge. This shift in paradigm has the potential to lower the threshold for entry, expand the science community, and increase opportunities for collaboration while promoting scientific innovation, transparency, and reproducibility. Yet, we have all witnessed promising new tools which seem harmless and beneficial at the outset become damaging or limiting.

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence and machine learning are ubiquitous in the domain of Earth Observation (EO) and Remote Sensing. Congruent to their success in the domain of computer vision, they have proven to obtain high accuracies for EO applications. Yet experts of EO should also consider the weaknesses of complex, machine-learning models before adopting them for specific applications. One such weakness is the lack of explainability of complex deep learning models. This paper reviews published examples of explainable ML or explainable AI in the field of Earth Observation. Explainability methods are classified as: intrinsic versus post-hoc, model-specific versus model-agnostic, and global versus local explanations and examples of each type are provided. This paper also identifies key explainability requirements identified the social sciences and upcoming regulatory recommendations from UNESCO Ethics of Artificial Intelligence and requirements from the EU draft Artificial Intelligence Act and analyzes whether these limitations are sufficiently addressed in the field of EO. The findings indicate that there is a lack of clarity regarding which models can be considered interpretable or not. EO applications often utilize Random Forests as an “interpretable” benchmark algorithm to compare to complex deep-learning models even though social sciences clearly argue that large Random Forests cannot be considered as such. Secondly, most explanations target domain experts and not possible users of the algorithm, regulatory bodies, or those who might be affected by an algorithm’s decisions. Finally, publications tend to simply provide explanations without testing the usefulness of the explanation by the intended audience. In light of these societal and regulatory considerations, a framework is provided to guide the selection of an appropriate machine learning algorithm based on the availability of simpler algorithms with a high predictive accuracy as well as the purpose and intended audience of the explanation.},

We examine aspects of ‘what’ and ‘why’, such as ‘what’ science problems ML tools have been used to address, ‘what’ was learned when using ML, and ‘why’ authors used ML methods. We find a variety of research questions have been addressed, ranging from small-scale predictions of sediment transport to larger-scale sand bar morphodynamics and coastal overwash on a developed island. We find various reasons justify the use of ML, including maximize predictability, emulation of model components, the need for smooth and continuous nonlinear regression, and explicit inclusion of uncertainty. The expanding use of ML has allowed for an expanding set of questions to be addressed. After reviewing the studies we outline a set of best practices for coastal researchers using machine learning methods. Finally we suggest possible areas for future research, including the use of novel machine learning techniques and exploring open data that is becoming increasingly available.},

The U.S. Southeast (extending from the Virginia—North Carolina border to the Texas—Mexican border), due to its relatively low relief, appears to be one of our nation's most vulnerable regions. In this study a Coastal Risk Assessment Database was developed for use with a geographic information system to identify the coastal areas at risk to erosion, permanent inundation, and episodic flooding in the U.S. Southeast. This database contains 13 land, marine, and climatological variables, including: lithology, elevation, subsidence, erosion/accretion, tropical storm probabilities of occurrence, and maximum storm surge. These variables were grouped into three categories using factor analysis. Each category was then weighted based on its perceived importance in determining the relative risk of an area to erosion or inundation. These weighted factors were used to calculate a risk index. This index classified approximately 30\% of the Gulf Coast and 15\% of the East Coast as being at very high risk to inundation or increased erosion from sealevel rise. High risk coastlines, as defined here, have one or more of the following characteristics: low coastal elevations, erodible substrates (i.e., sand or other unconsolidated sediments), present and past evidence of subsidence, histories of extensive shoreline retreat, high wave/tide energies, and high probabilities of being hit by tropical storms, hurricanes, or extratropical cyclones.},

  abstract = {A rise of sea level between 0.3 and 0.9 m by the end of the next century, caused by predicted greenhouse climate warming, would endanger human populations, cities, ports, and wetlands in low-lying coastal areas, through inundation, erosion and salinization. The consequences of a global sea level rise would be spatially non-uniform because of local or regional vertical crustal movements, differential resistance to erosion, varying wave climates, and changeable longshore currents. Although many factors can influence sea level, leading to a noisy record, various studies utilizing tide-gauge data find an average global rate of sea level rise of 1–2 mm/yr, over the last 100 years. This trend is part of a general rise over the last 300 years, since the low point of the Little Ice Age. Sea level rise may accelerate 3–8 times over present rates, within the next century. The permanently inundated coastal zone would extend to a depth equivalent to the vertical rise in sea level. Major river deltas, coastal wetlands and coral islands would be most affected. Episodic flooding by storm waves and surges would penetrate even farther inland. Beach and cliff erosion will be accentuated. Saltwater penetration into coastal aquifers and estuaries could contaminate urban water supplies and affect agricultural production. Research on relative risks and impacts of sea level rise on specific localities is still at an early stage. Development of a global coastal hazards data base, intended to provide an overview of the relative vulnerabilities of the world's coastlines, is described in this paper. To date, information on seven variables, associated with inundation and erosion hazards, has been compiled for the U.S., and parts of Canada and Mexico. A coastal vulnerability index (CVI) has been designed to flag high risk coastal segments. Preliminary results are presented for the eastern United States, as a test case.},

Potential impacts of this accelerated sea level rise include inundation, both permanent and episodic, increased shoreline retreat, and saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers and estuaries. A coastal hazards data base, described here, is designed to determine the differential vulnerability of the world's shorelines to inundation and erosion factors, on regional to global scales, and to screen out targets for more detailed studies. High risk shorelines are characterized by low relief, and erodible substrate, past and present evidence of subsidence, extensive shoreline retreat and high wave/tide energies. The coastal hazards data base contains information on seven variables, relating to inundation and erosion risks. Each of these, consisting of either numerical or nominal data, is assigned a rank from 1 to 5, based on assessment of the relative risk factor. These risk factors are then combined into an overall coastal vulnerability index, CVI. Preliminary results and analysis are presented here for the East Coast, U.S.A., as a test case. The data base is being extended to the rest of North America, with ultimate global coverage planned. Based on the criteria used, high risk areas along the East Coast include parts of Cape Cod, Long Island and the New Jersey barrier beaches, the North Carolina Outer Banks, the southern Delmarva Peninsula, and Georgia-South Carolina. Although the high risk status for most of these sites could have been anticipated, the CVI approach allows further differentiation among these sites and a more precise evaluation of the contributing factors. The procedure can be adapted for more detailed studies at higher resolution.},

The 100-year storm is simulated using a chain of stochastic and physics-based models combined with a scenario-based approach. Storm surge and wave spectral parameters, obtained from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ North Atlantic Coast Comprehensive Study (NACCS), are used as boundary conditions for high-resolution wave simulations, performed in the coastal and inundation zones using the steady-state spectral wave model STWAVE. Selected scenarios are defined to assess the magnitude of the variability in predicted damage resulting from the uncertainty in SLR, erosion rate, and time at which the 100-year storm would occur. Erosion rates are based on empirical analyses of historic rates of shoreline change, SLR measurements, and coastal erosion theory. The risk is measured in terms of damage to individual houses, based on damage curves developed in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, NACCS study. In addition, remediation scenarios are explored, demonstrating that a combination of dune replenishment and an increase in the residential resilience by elevating structures can significantly diminish the risk to the coastal community.},

Results show that treebased models remain state-of-the-art on medium-sized data (∼10K samples) even without accounting for their superior speed. To understand this gap, we conduct an empirical investigation into the differing inductive biases of tree-based models and Neural Networks (NNs). This leads to a series of challenges which should guide researchers aiming to build tabular-specific NNs: 1. be robust to uninformative features, 2. preserve the orientation of the data, and 3. be able to easily learn irregular functions. To stimulate research on tabular architectures, we contribute a standard benchmark and raw data for baselines: every point of a 20 000 compute hours hyperparameter search for each learner.},

  abstract = {Sea level rise during the 21st century will have a wide range of effects on coastal environments, human development, and infrastructure in coastal areas. The broad range of complex factors influencing coastal systems contributes to large uncertainties in predicting long-term sea level rise impacts. Here we explore and demonstrate the capabilities of a Bayesian network (BN) to predict long-term shoreline change associated with sea level rise and make quantitative assessments of prediction uncertainty. A BN is used to define relationships between driving forces, geologic constraints, and coastal response for the U.S. Atlantic coast that include observations of local rates of relative sea level rise, wave height, tide range, geomorphic classification, coastal slope, and shoreline change rate. The BN is used to make probabilistic predictions of shoreline retreat in response to different future sea level rise rates. Results demonstrate that the probability of shoreline retreat increases with higher rates of sea level rise. Where more specific information is included, the probability of shoreline change increases in a number of cases, indicating more confident predictions. A hindcast evaluation of the BN indicates that the network correctly predicts 71\% of the cases. Evaluation of the results using Brier skill and log likelihood ratio scores indicates that the network provides shoreline change predictions that are better than the prior probability. Shoreline change outcomes indicating stability (−1 {$<$} rate {$<$} 1 m/yr) or erosion (rate {$<$} −1 m/yr) tend to occur for two sets of input scenarios. Stable shoreline change rates occur mainly for low rates of relative sea level rise and occur in low-vulnerability geomorphic settings. Rates indicating erosion result for cases where the rate of relative sea level rise is high and moderate-to-high vulnerability geomorphic settings occur. In contrast, accretion (rate {$>$} 1 m/yr) was not well predicted. We find that BNs can assimilate important factors contributing to coastal change in response to sea level rise and can make quantitative, probabilistic predictions that can be applied to coastal management decisions.},

The paper aims to discuss these issues and the expected coastal retreat as a consequence of manmade climate changes, e.g., sea level rise (SLR) and increased storminess in the coming decades. Several beaches (Buceo, Malvín, Pocitos, Ramírez) and two tidal creek sandy mouths (Carrasco and Pando), with different characteristics but all constrained by coastal linear infrastructure were studied. These sites are located along the urbanised coast of the middle region of Río de la Plata microtidal river estuary. All of them show a more or less strong retreat trend with alternated fluctuations, e.g., weak retreat likely due to sea level rise, significant erosion very likely due to storm surges, and processes of loss of sediment stock, as well as episodes of sand recovery. Therefore, these beaches require interventions to preserve their beach prism and dry sand surface. In search for answers to better understand why and under what conditions the process of advance and retreat of the coastline occur, we have analysed different teleconnections and carried out reanalyses for wind anomalies during ENSO events from 1951 to 2010. Both weak and moderate erosion–accretion periods are likely related to atmospheric anomalies, e.g., wind direction changes and the consequent swell and littoral drift changes, related to El Niño and La Niña events. The former associated with accretion and the latter with erosion. In the past most interventions have been reactive. Increased knowledge of climate and weather relationship with the sedimentary balance provides an approach that would allow developing beach risk-management, pro-active strategies and climate adaption measures focused on the generation and recovery planning based on the analysis of the occurrence and prediction of El Niño/La Niña events.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Adaptation to coastal flood risk is hampered by high uncertainty in the rate and magnitude of sea-level rise. Subsequently, adaptation decisions carry strong risks of under- or over-investment, and could lead to costly retrofitting or unnecessary high margins. To better allocate resources timely and effectively, and achieve long-term sustainability, planners could utilise adaptation pathways, revealing the path-dependencies of adaptation options. This helps to identify low-regret short-term decisions that preserve options in an uncertain future, while monitoring to detect signals to adapt. A major barrier to the application of adaptation pathways is limited experience. To facilitate this, here we generalize this pathways approach for six common coastal archetypes, resulting in generic pathways suitable to be adjusted to local conditions. This provides a much richer analysis of coastal adaptation than provided by any previous analysis, by assessing the solution space and options over time for a variety of coastal regions. Based on this analysis, we find that the number of adaptation options declines while sea-level rises. For some archetypes, it becomes clear that long-term thinking is needed now, about if, how and when to move to transformative options, such as planned retreat, which may presently not be considered or acceptable. Our analysis further shows that coastal adaptation needs to start earlier than anticipated, especially given time required for local debate and choice and to implement measures.},

  abstract = {Without adaptation, sea-level rise (SLR) will put more people at risk of flooding. This requires a timely and adequate commitment to adaptation. In this paper, we show how adaptation needs to unfold over time to manage climate-induced SLR. We use a novel scenario-neutral approach, applied globally and subsequently combined with SLR and population scenarios, to assess when, where, and how fast to adapt up to 2150. As rates of SLR accelerate, adaptation needs to occur at an increasing pace or at a larger scale. While it is certain that adaptation will be necessary, it is uncertain when and how fast. After only~∼~0.15~m SLR relative to 2020, 1 million people need to adapt to permanent submergence and the amount of people at risk of a 100-year flood increases with 21\% to 83 million people. This would occur in the next 30 (20–45) years for RCP4.5 and within 25 (18–36) years under RCP8.5, assuming no change in protection or population. The uncertainty in timing increases with higher SLR, albeit for some impacts it can still a matter of time. Population at risk of a 100-year flood doubles after 0.75~m SLR which could occur by~∼~2080 (2068–2088), 2100 (2085–2130), or 2150 (2115-beyond 2150) under a high-end, RCP8.5, or RCP4.5 scenario respectively. The rate, at which the risk increases, differs strongly per country. In some countries an additional 1–5~million people of the present population will be at risk of a 100-year flood within the next two decades, while others have more time to adapt but will see rapid growth of risk past 2100. Combining SLR impacts with projected population change further increases the number of people at risk of a 100-year flood by ∼13\% between 2040–2060 (under both RCP8.5-SSP5 and RCP4.5-SSP2). This can be managed through protecting, floodproofing or limiting developments in high-risk areas. A commitment to adaptation is inevitable to maintain risk at present levels. With increasing warnings of the potential for accelerated SLR due to rapid ice sheet melt, adaptation may need to happen faster and sooner than previously anticipated which can have consequences for how to adapt. Failure to acknowledge the potential and long-term (including beyond 2100) adaptation commitment in development and adaptation planning may lead to a commitment gap and subsequently expensive retrofitting of infrastructure, creation of stranded assets, and less time to adapt at greater cost. In contrast, considering the long-term adaptation commitment can support timely adaptation and alignment with other societal goals.},

Scenarios of potential changes in coastal flood risk due to changes in climate, society and the economy over the twenty-first century have been analysed using a national-scale quantified flood risk analysis methodology. If it is assumed that there will be no adaptation to increasing coastal flood risk, the expected annual damage in England and Wales due to coastal flooding is predicted to increase from the current £0.5 billion to between £1.0 and £13.5 billion, depending on the scenario of climate and socio-economic change. The proportion of national flood risk that is attributable to coastal flooding is projected to increase from roughly 50\% to between 60 and 70\%. Scenarios of adaptation to increasing risk, by construction of coastal dikes or retreat from coastal floodplains, are analysed. These adaptations are shown to be able to reduce coastal flood risk to between £0.2 and £0.8 billion. The capital cost of the associated coastal engineering works is estimated to be between £12 and £40 billion. Non-structural measures to reduce risk can make a major contribution to reducing the cost and environmental impact of engineering measures.},

Flood risk management is the process of data and information gathering, risk assessment, appraisal of options, and making, implementing, and reviewing decisions to reduce, control, accept, or redistribute risks of flooding. Integrated flood risk management explicitly recognizes the interrelationships between all risk management measures, and their analysis, costs, and effectiveness, within changing social, economic, and environmental contexts. It can be helped by improving access to data and models, sharing and communicating risk analyses, involving a wider range of stakeholders, and coordinating risk management actions.

In the Earth System Sciences (ESS) community, we are facing an explosion of data volumes where new datasets, sourced from models, in-situ observations, and remote sensing platforms, are being made available at prohibitively large volumes to store and work with using conventional computational approaches. Furthermore, there is a growing recognition that the fragmentation of software tools and environments renders most geoscientific research effectively unreproducible and prone to failure. While the private data-science community has been actively developing big-data and open-source solutions to these problems, the academic community has begun to lag, leading to a growing technology gap between the two sectors. Pangeo is a community driven effort for open-source big-data in the Earth System Sciences. Pangeo's mission is to cultivate an ecosystem in which the next generation of open-source analysis tools for the geosciences can be developed, distributed, and sustained. In this presentation, we will introduce the core concepts driving the development throughout the Pangeo community and will describe our recent efforts towards 1) closing the gaps in scalability and technology and 2) building an interdisciplinary community to develop and sustain the technology needed to leverage big data in ESS. We will discuss the core software libraries of the Pangeo ecosystem, Python, Xarray, Dask, and Jupyter and will provide examples of how these tools, when deployed on both high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud computing systems are allowing scientists to scale their workflows on large datasets.},

  abstract = {The coastal environment is home to a range of landforms and landscapes that include those at either end of the sensitivity scale. The soft coastal landscapes of beaches, sand dunes, and mudflats represent fast-responding and mobile geomorphic systems that are highly sensitive to environmental change. On the other hand, coastal landscapes in areas of hard rock and inherited Quaternary deposits represent relatively slow-responding systems that are, in the main, thought to be relatively insensitive to change. This paper focuses upon both groups of systems and demonstrates not only how soft coasts respond to environmental stimuli over a variety of time scales but also how this inheritance shapes subsequent development. Using mainly Scottish soft coast examples, the changes associated with sensitive coastal landscapes are assessed in terms of the past timing and magnitude of changes in both sea level and sediment economy. Declining abundance of coastal sediment has initiated a process of internal re-organisation that, because of an inherent sensitivity to sea level change and low thresholds for the forcing of change, fundamentally restricts future management options. The paper also attempts to show that hard rock coasts are also responsive to particular types of event on short time scales and examples are discussed that modify the accepted view of hard rock insensitivity to environmental change. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Extratropical cyclones (ETCs) are the primary driver of large-scale episodic beach erosion along coastlines in temperate regions. However, key drivers of the magnitude and regional variability in rapid morphological changes caused by ETCs at the coast remain poorly understood. Here we analyze an unprecedented dataset of high-resolution regional-scale morphological response to an ETC that impacted southeast Australia, and evaluate the new observations within the context of an existing long-term coastal monitoring program. This ETC was characterized by moderate intensity (for this regional setting) deepwater wave heights, but an anomalous wave direction approximately 45 degrees more counter-clockwise than average. The magnitude of measured beach volume change was the largest in four decades at the long-term monitoring site and, at the regional scale, commensurate with that observed due to extreme North Atlantic hurricanes. Spatial variability in morphological response across the study region was predominantly controlled by alongshore gradients in storm wave energy flux and local coastline alignment relative to storm wave direction. We attribute the severity of coastal erosion observed due to this ETC primarily to its anomalous wave direction, and call for greater research on the impacts of changing storm wave directionality in addition to projected future changes in wave heights.},

To aid in development of CF-compliant software and to capture with a minimal set of elements all of the information contained in the CF conventions, we propose a formal data model for CF which is independent of netCDF and describes all possible CF-compliant data. Because such data will often be analysed and visualised using software based on other data models, we compare our CF data model with the ISO 19123 coverage model, the Open Geospatial Consortium CF netCDF standard, and the Unidata Common Data Model. To demonstrate that this CF data model can in fact be implemented, we present cf-python, a Python software library that conforms to the model and can manipulate any CF-compliant dataset.},

We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers—8× deeper than VGG nets [41] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task.

  abstract = {Deep learning-based coastline detection algorithms have begun to outshine traditional statistical methods in recent years. However, they are usually trained only as single-purpose models to either segment land and water or delineate the coastline. In contrast to this, a human annotator will usually keep a mental map of both segmentation and delineation when performing manual coastline detection. To take into account this task duality, we therefore devise a new model to unite these two approaches in a deep learning model. By taking inspiration from the main building blocks of a semantic segmentation framework (UNet) and an edge detection framework (HED), both tasks are combined in a natural way. Training is made efficient by employing deep supervision on side predictions at multiple resolutions. Finally, a hierarchical attention mechanism is introduced to adaptively merge these multiscale predictions into the final model output. The advantages of this approach over other traditional and deep learning-based methods for coastline detection are demonstrated on a dataset of Sentinel-1 imagery covering parts of the Antarctic coast, where coastline detection is notoriously difficult. An implementation of our method is available at \textbackslash url\{https://github.com/khdlr/HED-UNet\}.},

Our approach efficiently detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance. The method, called Mask R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Without bells and whistles, Mask R-CNN outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in instance-level recognition.

  abstract = {Coastal flood damage and adaptation costs under 21st century sea-level rise are assessed on a global scale taking into account a wide range of uncertainties in continental topography data, population data, protection strategies, socioeconomic development and sea-level rise. Uncertainty in global mean and regional sea level was derived from four different climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5, each combined with three land-ice scenarios based on the published range of contributions from ice sheets and glaciers. Without adaptation, 0.2–4.6\% of global population is expected to be flooded annually in 2100 under 25–123 cm of global mean sea-level rise, with expected annual losses of 0.3–9.3\% of global gross domestic product. Damages of this magnitude are very unlikely to be tolerated by society and adaptation will be widespread. The global costs of protecting the coast with dikes are significant with annual investment and maintenance costs of US\$ 12–71 billion in 2100, but much smaller than the global cost of avoided damages even without accounting for indirect costs of damage to regional production supply. Flood damages by the end of this century are much more sensitive to the applied protection strategy than to variations in climate and socioeconomic scenarios as well as in physical data sources (topography and climate model). Our results emphasize the central role of long-term coastal adaptation strategies. These should also take into account that protecting large parts of the developed coast increases the risk of catastrophic consequences in the case of defense failure.},

  abstract = {The issue of ‘‘measuring’’ climate change vulnerability and adaptive capacity by means of indicators divides policy and academic communities. While policy increasingly demands such indicators an increasing body of literature criticises them. This misfit results from a twofold confusion. First, there is confusion about what vulnerability indicators are and which arguments are available for building them. Second, there is confusion about the kinds of policy problems to be solved by means of indicators. This paper addresses both sources of confusion. It first develops a rigorous conceptual framework for vulnerability indicators and applies it to review the scientific arguments available for building climate change vulnerability indicators. Then, it opposes this availability with the following six diverse types of problems that vulnerability indicators are meant to address according to the literature: (i) identification of mitigation targets; (ii) identification of vulnerable people, communities, regions, etc.; (iii) raising awareness; (iv) allocation of adaptation funds; (v) monitoring of adaptation policy; and (vi) conducting scientific research. It is found that vulnerability indicators are only appropriate for addressing the second type of problem but only at local scales, when systems can be narrowly defined and inductive arguments can be built. For the other five types of problems, either vulnerability is not the adequate concept or vulnerability indicators are not the adequate methodology. I conclude that both the policy and academic communities should collaboratively attempt to use a more specific terminology for speaking about the problems addressed and the methodologies applied. The one-size-fits-all vulnerability label is not sufficient. Speaking of ‘‘measuring’’ vulnerability is particularly misleading, as this is impossible and raises false expectations.},

  abstract = {Despite widespread efforts to implement climate services, there is almost no literature that systematically analyzes users' needs. This paper addresses this gap by applying a decision analysis perspective to identify what kind of mean sea level rise (SLR) information is needed for local coastal adaptation decisions. We first characterize these decisions, then identify suitable decision analysis approaches and the sea level information required, and finally discuss if and how these information needs can be met given the state of the art of sea level science. We find that four types of information are needed: (i) probabilistic predictions for short-term decisions when users are uncertainty tolerant; (ii) high-end and low-end SLR scenarios chosen for different levels of uncertainty tolerance; (iii) upper bounds of SLR for users with a low uncertainty tolerance; and (iv) learning scenarios derived from estimating what knowledge will plausibly emerge about SLR over time. Probabilistic predictions can only be attained for the near term (i.e., 2030–2050) before SLR significantly diverges between low and high emission scenarios, for locations for which modes of climate variability are well understood and the vertical land movement contribution to local sea levels is small. Meaningful SLR upper bounds cannot be defined unambiguously from a physical perspective. Low- to high-end scenarios for different levels of uncertainty tolerance and learning scenarios can be produced, but this involves both expert and user judgments. The decision analysis procedure elaborated here can be applied to other types of climate information that are required for mitigation and adaptation purposes.},

  abstract = {This study provides a literature-based comparative assessment of uncertainties and biases in global to world-regional scale assessments of current and future coastal flood risks, considering mean and extreme sea-level hazards, the propagation of these into the floodplain, people and coastal assets exposed, and their vulnerability. Globally, by far the largest bias is introduced by not considering human adaptation, which can lead to an overestimation of coastal flood risk in 2100 by up to factor 1300. But even when considering adaptation, uncertainties in how coastal societies will adapt to sea-level rise dominate with a factor of up to 27 all other uncertainties. Other large uncertainties that have been quantified globally are associated with socio-economic development (factors 2.3–5.8), digital elevation data (factors 1.2–3.8), ice sheet models (factor 1.6–3.8) and greenhouse gas emissions (factors 1.6–2.1). Local uncertainties that stand out but have not been quantified globally, relate to depth-damage functions, defense failure mechanisms, surge and wave heights in areas affected by tropical cyclones (in particular for large return periods), as well as nearshore interactions between mean sea-levels, storm surges, tides and waves. Advancing the state-of-the-art requires analyzing and reporting more comprehensively on underlying uncertainties, including those in data, methods and adaptation scenarios. Epistemic uncertainties in digital elevation, coastal protection levels and depth-damage functions would be best reduced through open community-based efforts, in which many scholars work together in collecting and validating these data.},

  abstract = {This study provides a literature-based comparative assessment of uncertainties and biases in global to world-regional scale assessments of current and future coastal flood risks, considering mean and extreme sea-level hazards, the propagation of these into the floodplain, people and coastal assets exposed, and their vulnerability. Globally, by far the largest bias is introduced by not considering human adaptation, which can lead to an overestimation of coastal flood risk in 2100 by up to factor 1300. But even when considering adaptation, uncertainties in how coastal societies will adapt to sea-level rise dominate with a factor of up to 27 all other uncertainties. Other large uncertainties that have been quantified globally are associated with socio-economic development (factors 2.3–5.8), digital elevation data (factors 1.2–3.8), ice sheet models (factor 1.6–3.8) and greenhouse gas emissions (factors 1.6–2.1). Local uncertainties that stand out but have not been quantified globally, relate to depth-damage functions, defense failure mechanisms, surge and wave heights in areas affected by tropical cyclones (in particular for large return periods), as well as nearshore interactions between mean sea-levels, storm surges, tides and waves. Advancing the state-of-the-art requires analyzing and reporting more comprehensively on underlying uncertainties, including those in data, methods and adaptation scenarios. Epistemic uncertainties in digital elevation, coastal protection levels and depth-damage functions would be best reduced through open community-based efforts, in which many scholars work together in collecting and validating these data.},

  abstract = {Deep learning (DL) has great influence on large parts of science and increasingly established itself as an adaptive method for new challenges in the field of Earth observation (EO). Nevertheless, the entry barriers for EO researchers are high due to the dense and rapidly developing field mainly driven by advances in computer vision (CV). To lower the barriers for researchers in EO, this review gives an overview of the evolution of DL with a focus on image segmentation and object detection in convolutional neural networks (CNN). The survey starts in 2012, when a CNN set new standards in image recognition, and lasts until late 2019. Thereby, we highlight the connections between the most important CNN architectures and cornerstones coming from CV in order to alleviate the evaluation of modern DL models. Furthermore, we briefly outline the evolution of the most popular DL frameworks and provide a summary of datasets in EO. By discussing well performing DL architectures on these datasets as well as reflecting on advances made in CV and their impact on future research in EO, we narrow the gap between the reviewed, theoretical concepts from CV and practical application in EO.},

  abstract = {Despite the considerable research that has sought to describe past and predict future shoreline change, little consensus has emerged on the best methodology for forecasting future shoreline positions. While a certain degree of heterogeneity in approach is warranted given the variability in coastal geomorphology and sediment-transport processes, the prediction error associated with each method has not been evaluated in great detail. In this study, measured shoreline positions from Delaware and New York were used to calculate long-term erosion rates and make predictions to subsequent, known positions. Rates were calculated using end-point and linear-regression methods, including and excluding storm-specific shorelines. Those rate computations that included storm-specific shorelines yielded consistently poor predictions (average factor-of-three increase in error) compared with non-storm erosion rates, regardless of rate-calculation method. Linear-regression predictions, on average, performed better than end-point rate predictions, reducing error by over 70\% in New York and 34\% in Delaware for rates including storm shorelines, and between 4 and 31\% for non-storm data (DE and NY, respectively). Predictions (hindcasts) were also made to 19th century shoreline positions using rates computed with modern, non-storm data. The positions predicted along relatively undeveloped stretches of the coast were within the 95\% confidence interval associated with the prediction. Hindcasts made in areas characterized by heavy development and/or beach nourishment projects were poor, as would be expected given the recent alteration of the natural sediment-supply system. For all locations, inclusion of 19th century data reduced uncertainty in forecasts of 21st century shoreline positions by roughly 44\%. These results show that forecasts derived from linear-regression rates using non-storm, 19th and 20th century data produce the lowest prediction error and uncertainty in the long-term trend.},

Consequently, existing models produce widely differing predictions of sea-level rise even for the same temperature scenario. Here we present results of a broad survey of 90 experts who were amongst the most active scientific publishers on the topic of sea level in recent years. They provided a probabilistic assessment of sea-level rise by AD 2100 and AD 2300 under two contrasting temperature scenarios. For the low scenario, which limits warming to {$<$}2~°C above pre-industrial temperature and has slowly falling temperature after AD 2050, the median ‘likely’ range provided by the experts is 0.4–0.6~m by AD 2100 and 0.6–1.0~m by AD 2300, suggesting a good chance to limit future sea-level rise to {$<$}1.0~m if climate mitigation measures are successfully implemented. In contrast, for the high warming scenario (4.5~°C by AD 2100 and 8~°C in AD 2300) the median likely ranges are 0.7–1.2~m by AD 2100 and 2.0–3.0~m by AD 2300, calling into question the future survival of some coastal cities and low-lying island nations.},

MobileNetV3 is tuned to mobile phone CPUs through a combination of hardware-aware network architecture search (NAS) complemented by the NetAdapt algorithm and then subsequently improved through novel architecture advances. This paper starts the exploration of how automated search algorithms and network design can work together to harness complementary approaches improving the overall state of the art. Through this process we create two new MobileNet models for release: MobileNetV3-Large and MobileNetV3-Small which are targeted for high and low resource use cases. These models are then adapted and applied to the tasks of object detection and semantic segmentation. For the task of semantic segmentation (or any dense pixel prediction), we propose a new efficient segmentation decoder Lite Reduced Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (LR-ASPP). We achieve new state of the art results for mobile classification, detection and segmentation. MobileNetV3-Large is 3.2\textbackslash\% more accurate on ImageNet classification while reducing latency by 15\textbackslash\% compared to MobileNetV2. MobileNetV3-Small is 4.6\textbackslash\% more accurate while reducing latency by 5\textbackslash\% compared to MobileNetV2. MobileNetV3-Large detection is 25\textbackslash\% faster at roughly the same accuracy as MobileNetV2 on COCO detection. MobileNetV3-Large LR-ASPP is 30\textbackslash\% faster than MobileNetV2 R-ASPP at similar accuracy for Cityscapes segmentation.},

  abstract = {Muddy coasts offer ecological habitats, provide food, and form a natural coastal defence against flooding and erosion. Especially in combination with salt marshes or mangroves they constitute important ecosystem services. In the near future relative sea level rise, changing coastal wave energy and human interventions will further increase the pressure on muddy coastal zones. For a sustainable, ecosystem-based coastal management it is key to obtain information on the geomorphology and historical changes along muddy areas, that are vulnerable to these pressures. So far, little is known about the distribution and behaviour of muddy coasts at a global scale. In this study we present a global-scale assessment of the occurrence of muddy coasts and rates of coastline change therein. We combine publicly available satellite imagery and coastal geospatial datasets, to develop an automated classification method to identify muddy coasts along the world’s coastlines. Applying supervised machine learning on multispectral properties of muddy coasts at pixel level and geospatial characteristics of muddy coasts at transect level, we found that 12\% of the world’s ice-free coastline is muddy, of which 60\% is located in the tropics. We found that the majority of the world’s muddy coasts are eroding at rates exceeding 0.5 m/yr over the last three decades, while the Ganges delta and Amazone region are retreating at mean rates exceeding -1.3 m/yr.},

  abstract = {The coastal area provides important services such as valuable habitats for wildlife, resources for regional development, and buffer zones for the land against natural disasters such as storm surges. But these narrow coastal areas experience pressure from both land and ocean side. In order to regulate sustainable coastal development, protect coastal areas from natural forces, implement ecosystem protection strategies and mitigate the impacts of climate change on coastlines, it is crucial to observe and quantify the changes along coastlines that are vulnerable to these pressures. Among the various coastal environments, the focus of this master thesis is on muddy coasts. A muddy coast is defined as a coastal depositional environment that is usually formed along an unsheltered coastline exposed to low energy conditions and that consists mainly of fine sediments, which are smaller than 63 micrometres in diameter. So far, few methods have been developed to detect sandy coasts and the rate of change of sandy coastlines at global scale, but little is known about the detection and behaviour of muddy coasts. The main objective of this thesis is to develop an automated classification method to identify muddy coasts along all the coastlines of the world. The main objective can be translated into the following research question: How can a reliable global mud classification be obtained by analysing the characteristics of muddy coasts using publicly available satellite remote sensing techniques and globally available coastal datasets? To obtain a reliable global mud classification, a method based on the spectral properties of individual mud patches and on the physical geographical characteristics of muddy coasts is proposed.\&lt;br/\&gt;The spectral properties of individual mud patches are studied at pixel level using multispectral satellite images and the physical geographical characteristics of a muddy coastal system are studied using seven globally available coastal datasets. The information from the multispectral images and the information from the coastal datasets are used as the input of the development of a hybrid coastal transect classification model, in order to obtain a more reliable and robust classification model that can detect muddy coasts at global scale. With supervised machine learning the hybrid coastal transect classification model is developed, which can classify global coastlines into five coastal types: plain beaches, muddy coasts, coastal cliffs, vegetated coasts and other. 85 percent of the muddy coasts are correctly recognised by the hybrid classification model. The accuracy of the hybrid model is still increasing significantly, meaning that the model could perform even better if more training data is added to train the model. The large amount of training and validation data at both pixel and transect level resulted in a reliable, robust global mud classification model. With the addition of the coastal datasets, the model performs better than when only the multispectral satellite images are used for classifying muddy coasts. The hybrid classification model is used to classify 100000 global coastal transects from which 12 percent are classified as muddy coasts; 60 percent of the classified muddy coasts are in the tropics.},

  abstract = {Coastal hazards are among the world’s most threatening hazards. With half of the world’s population living near the coast, an immense threat is posed by these hazards to life and health, livelihood, and the economy. In this chapter, characteristics of coastal hazards are described, first by presenting a historical context, then by laying out our current understanding of the physical problems of interest for coastal design, and finally by presenting simple methods for initial interpretation of the hazard. A number of natural processes and anthropogenic activities adversely impact coastal communities, critical infrastructure, and port facilities along the coast. Natural coastal hazards may generally be classified into those that are episodic and those that occur over long periods of time. Episodic hazards include coastal storms and tsunamis while long-term hazards include, for example, sea-level rise . Many anthropogenic activities also result in long-term impacts at the coast. For example, inland dam construction produces long-term impacts on coastal sediment supply. In the following, we describe the most common coastal hazards and then discuss methods for evaluating their impacts at the coast.},

  abstract = {Polygon-based terrain classification data were created globally using 280 m digital elevation models (DEMs) interpolated from the multi-error-removed improved-terrain DEM (MERIT DEM). First, area segmentation was performed globally with the logarithmic value of slope gradient and the local convexity calculated from the DEM. Next, by adding surface texture, k-means clustering was performed globally and the polygons were grouped into 40 clusters. Then, we tried to reclassify these 40 clusters into geomorphologic terrain groups. In this study, we attempted reclassification and grouping using local information from Japan as a test case. The 40 clusters were compared with Japanese geological and geomorphological data and were then reclassified into 12 groups that had different geomorphological and geological characteristics. In addition, large shape landforms, mountains, and hills were subdivided by using the combined texture. Finally, 15 groups were created as terrain groups. Cross tabulations were performed with geological or lithological maps of California and Australia in order to investigate if the Japanese grouping of the clusters was also meaningful for other regions. The classification is improved from previous studies that used 1-km DEMs, especially for the representation of terrace shapes and landform elements smaller than 1 km. The results were generally suitable for distinguishing bedrock mountains, hills, large highland slopes, intermediate landforms (plateaus, terraces, large lowland slopes), and plains. On the other hand, the cross tabulations indicate that in the case of gentler landforms under different geologic provinces/climates, similar topographies may not always indicate similar formative mechanisms and lithology. This may be solved by locally replacing the legend; however, care is necessary for mixed areas where both depositional and erosional gentle plains exist. Moreover, the limit of the description of geometric signatures still appears in failure to detect narrow valley bottom plains, metropolitan areas, and slight rises in gentle plains. Therefore, both global and local perspectives regarding geologic province and climate are necessary for better grouping of the clusters, and additional parameters or higher resolution DEMs are necessary. Successful classification of terrain types of geomorphology may lead to a better understanding of terrain susceptibility to natural hazards and land development.},

  abstract = {The projected size and spatial distribution of the future population are important drivers of global change and key determinants of exposure and vulnerability to hazards. Spatial demographic projections are widely used as inputs to spatial projections of land use, energy use, and emissions, as well as to assessments of the impacts of extreme events, sea level rise, and other climate-related outcomes. To date, however, there are very few global-scale, spatially explicit population projections, and those that do exist are often based on simple scaling or trend extrapolation. Here we present a new set of global, spatially explicit population scenarios that are consistent with the new Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) developed to facilitate global change research. We use a parameterized gravity-based downscaling model to produce projections of spatial population change that are quantitatively consistent with national population and urbanization projections for the SSPs and qualitatively consistent with assumptions in the SSP narratives regarding spatial development patterns. We show that the five SSPs lead to substantially different spatial population outcomes at the continental, national, and sub-national scale. In general, grid cell-level outcomes are most influenced by national-level population change, second by urbanization rate, and third by assumptions about the spatial style of development. However, the relative importance of these factors is a function of the magnitude of the projected change in total population and urbanization for each country and across SSPs. We also demonstrate variation in outcomes considering the example of population existing in a low-elevation coastal zone under alternative scenarios.},

  abstract = {Many of the lessons concerning urban environmental problems are well documented and practiced in international environmental cooperation projects. However, most urban environmental issues analyzed in the past have concentrated exclusively on air pollution, surface water pollution and waste management in cities. With this in mind, we focus on uncovered subsurface environmental issues in cities, which is an emerging problem in developing countries in Asia. As a first step, we collected existing knowledge and information from the literature and synthesized it into a Driving Forces-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework (Jago-on et al. Sci Total Environ 407:3089–3104, 2009). Building on our previous work, the current analysis attempts to develop a stage model concerning the long-term relationships between urban development and the emerging subsurface environmental problem of land subsidence and to compare the differences and commonalities across Asian developing countries. With the help of the DPSIR framework, we select and quantify the relevant indicators for each component of the requisite framework. The results indicate that Taipei has successfully utilized its latecomer advantage and that Bangkok has benefited from its natural capacity for groundwater storage. In addition, we find that Jakarta and Manila lag behind the other cities in terms of both the recognition of the issue and the introduction of regulation to combat the problem.},

  abstract = {As a consequence of climate change, coastal communities worldwide are subject to increased risk from sea-level rise and more intense storms. Therefore, it is important for coastal managers to have focused site specific data on present and predicted climate change impacts in order to determine shoreline vulnerability. There are few UK studies that characterise coastal vulnerability, while nearly all global work has concentrated on geomorphological and to a lesser extent, socio-economic aspects. In response, the present study developed a new Physical Coastal Vulnerability Index (PCVI) and applied it to eleven UK sites, seven in England, three in Wales and one in Scotland. PCVI results were then compared and contrasted with a new Fiscal Coastal Vulnerability Index (FCVI), which enabled coastal areas to be visually classified in one of four categories to inform relative risk. Both indices were subsequently integrated into a Combined Coastal Vulnerability Index (CCVI). Results showed that Great Yarmouth and Aberystwyth were highly vulnerable, while Llanelli and Lynmouth were least vulnerable, and the importance of integrating both indices is demonstrated by modified overall vulnerability assessments. Therefore, CCVI provides a simple to use shoreline monitoring tool which is particularly suitable for assessment of risk. The indices support coastal planning, including intervention or no active intervention policies, and thereby benefitting a range of stakeholders. CCVI works at local, regional and international scales, and identifies vulnerable locations. Consequently, these indices will inform management strategies to improve coastal resilience under various sea level rise and climate change scenarios.},

  abstract = {Wave climate in southeast Queensland, Australia has been correlated to changes in the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), but observations of shoreline change associated with the variable wave climate have been limited due to a paucity of aerial photography, LiDAR, and other beach profiling datasets in this region. A multi-decadal, sub-annual temporal resolution shoreline dataset spanning 1996 to 2017 was produced using satellite imagery collected by Landsat 5, 7, and 8. A total of 147 shoreline positions were delineated using the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index on cloud-free imagery and corrected for horizontal offsets forced by variable tide stages at the satellite flyover time. The relative influence of SOI, the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and Subtropical Ridge Latitude (STR-L) and Pressure (STR-P) on shoreline dynamics along the Cooloola Sand Mass in Queensland are assessed by performing cross correlations between their respective index values and shoreline change distances calculated by the Digital Shoreline Analysis System. A bimodal climate control of shoreline change is observed dependent upon the phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). IPO modulates the impacts of ENSO on eastern Australia through its control over the position of the South Pacific Convergence Zone and elevating/lowering of tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures. During negative IPO, SOI is negatively correlated to the Cooloola Sand Mass shoreline indicating that the shoreline retreats during negative SOI phases. During positive IPO, the impacts of SOI are weakened and the STR becomes the primary driver of shoreline change with shoreline response being contingent upon its orientation. The SW-NE aligned Noosa North shoreline erodes in response to poleward movement of the STR, likely due to the enhanced cross-shore wave attack as a result of anti-clockwise wave rotation. The opposite response is shown at the SE-NW aligned Rainbow Beach shoreline, which is oriented almost parallel to the incident wave direction and is sheltered by the Double Island Point headland. These results suggest that climate control on shoreline change at Cooloola Sand Mass, and likely other sand islands in the region, is two-tiered, whereby interdecadal variability of the IPO governs the relative influence of SOI and STR under the different IPO phases. The linked climate and shoreline variability correlation shown in this study provides significant insight into how the Cooloola Sand Mass shoreline will respond to future climate changes under a global warming scenario.},

  abstract = {Sea-level rise due to both climate change and non-climatic factors threatens coastal settlements, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Projections of mean global sea-level (GSL) rise provide insufficient information to plan adaptive responses; local decisions require local projections that accommodate different risk tolerances and time frames and that can be linked to storm surge projections. Here we present a global set of local sea-level (LSL) projections to inform decisions on timescales ranging from the coming decades through the 22nd century. We provide complete probability distributions, informed by a combination of expert community assessment, expert elicitation, and process modeling. Between the years 2000 and 2100, we project a very likely (90\% probability) GSL rise of 0.5–1.2 m under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5, 0.4–0.9 m under RCP 4.5, and 0.3–0.8 m under RCP 2.6. Site-to-site differences in LSL projections are due to varying non-climatic background uplift or subsidence, oceanographic effects, and spatially variable responses of the geoid and the lithosphere to shrinking land ice. The Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) constitutes a growing share of variance in GSL and LSL projections. In the global average and at many locations, it is the dominant source of variance in late 21st century projections, though at some sites oceanographic processes contribute the largest share throughout the century. LSL rise dramatically reshapes flood risk, greatly increasing the expected number of “1-in-10” and “1-in-100” year events.},

  abstract = {We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5\% and 17.0\%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.},

This quantity is comparable to the positive vertical bias of the principle digital elevation model (DEM) used to assess global and national population exposures to extreme coastal water levels, NASA’s SRTM. CoastalDEM is a new DEM utilizing neural networks to reduce SRTM error. Here we show – employing CoastalDEM—that 190 M people (150–250 M, 90\% CI) currently occupy global land below projected high tide lines for 2100 under low carbon emissions, up from 110 M today, for a median increase of 80 M. These figures triple SRTM-based values. Under high emissions, CoastalDEM indicates up to 630 M people live on land below projected annual flood levels for 2100, and up to 340 M for mid-century, versus roughly 250 M at present. We estimate one billion people now occupy land less than 10 m above current high tide lines, including 230 M below 1 m.},

The transport relationship used in the model is based on wave impact theory, where individual swash waves hitting the dune face induce the erosion. Combining this relationship with the sediment volume conservation equation describes the response of the dune to high waves and water levels. Four different data sets on dune erosion, originating from the laboratory and the field, were employed to validate the model and to determine the value of an empirical transport coefficient appearing in the analytical solutions. The time evolution of dune recession observed in the different data sets was well described by the model, but the empirical coefficient showed some variation between cases, especially for the field data. In practical applications of the model, it is recommended to use a range of coefficient values to include an uncertainty estimate of calculated quantities, such as recession distance and eroded volume.},

The solution for a detached breakwater illustrates the growth of a salient with time behind the breakwater and the associated initial shoreline retreat at locations across from the breakwater tips. A simple solution describing flanking of a seawall is obtained by using two different solution areas where the longshore sand transport rate and breaking-wave angle vary. A similar technique is used to model diffraction downdrift of a groin or jetty by allowing the wave angle to vary with the distance alongshore according to a specified function or by employing a large number of solution areas. Cases are also presented for the accumulation updrift a groin and the shoreline response in a groin compartment with a breaking wave angle that varies sinusoidally in time. A solution for a single groin illustrates the impact of bypassing on the updrift accumulation.},

In particular, it can provide key information about the properties and behavior of sandy beaches and the surrounding vegetation, improving the ecomorphological understanding and modeling of coastal dynamics. Although satellite image processing usually demands high memory and computational resources, free online platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) have recently enabled their users to leverage cloud-based tools and handle big satellite data. In this technical note, we describe an algorithm to classify the coastal land cover and retrieve relevant information from Sentinel-2 and Landsat image collections at specific times or in a multitemporal way: the extent of the beach and vegetation strips, the statistics of the grass cover, and the position of the shoreline and the vegetation–sand interface. Furthermore, we validate the algorithm through both quantitative and qualitative methods, demonstrating the goodness of the derived classification (accuracy of approximately 90\%) and showing some examples about the use of the algorithm’s output to study coastal physical and ecological dynamics. Finally, we discuss the algorithm’s limitations and potentialities in light of its scaling for global analyses.},

  abstract = {Within the broad discourses of environmental change, sustainability science, and anthropogenic Earth-surface systems, a focused body of work involves the coupled economic and physical dynamics of developed shorelines. Rapid rates of change in coastal environments, from wetlands and deltas to inlets and dune systems, help researchers recognize, observe, and investigate coupling in natural (non-human) morphodynamics and biomorphodynamics. This same intrinsic quality of fast-paced change also makes developed coastal zones exemplars of observable coupling between physical processes and human activities. In many coastal communities, beach erosion is a natural hazard with economic costs that coastal management counters through a variety of mitigation strategies, including beach replenishment, groynes, revetments, and seawalls. As cycles of erosion and mitigation iterate, coastline change and economically driven interventions become mutually linked. Emergent dynamics of two-way economic–physical coupling is a recent research discovery. Having established a strong theoretical basis, research into coupled human–coastal systems has passed its early proof-of-concept phase. This paper frames three major challenges that need resolving in order to advance theoretical and empirical treatments of human–coastal systems: (1) codifying salient individual and social behaviors of decision-making in ways that capture societal actions across a range of scales (thus engaging economics, social science, and policy disciplines); (2) quantifying anthropogenic effects on alongshore and cross-shore sediment pathways and long-term landscape evolution in coastal zones through time, including direct measurement of cumulative changes to sediment cells resulting from coastal development and management practices (e.g., construction of buildings and artificial dunes, bulldozer removal of overwash after major storms); and (3) reciprocal knowledge and data exchange between researchers in coastal morphodynamics and practitioners of coastal management. Future research into human–coastal systems can benefit from decades of interdisciplinary work on the complex dynamics of common-pool resources, from computational efficiency and new techniques in numerical modeling, and from the growing catalog of high-resolution geospatial data for natural and developed coastlines around the world.},

The link is highly multiplicative, with the long-term shoreline retreat rate averaging about 150 times that of sea level rise. For example, a sustained rise of 10 cm in sea level could result in 15 m of shoreline erosion. Such an amount is more than an order of magnitude greater than would be expected from a simple response to sea level rise through inundation of the shoreline. Sea level is certainly only one of many factors causing long-term beach change. Shoreline revisions from inlet dynamics and coastal engineering projects are more pronounced in most areas of the US. east coast and tend to mask the effect of a rise in sea level even over extended intervals. The implication is that sea level rise is a secondary but inexorable cause of beach erosion in such areas.},

In this paper, we review previous studies that explored the relations between sea-level rise and shoreline changes over the last few decades. Existing methods can be classified into two groups: (1) approaches based on the analysis of trends and variability in shoreline change observations, which investigate whether a correlation with the temporal or spatial patterns sea level changes can be established; and (2) approaches based on the comparison of shoreline observations with a coastal model outcome, which attempt to evaluate the contribution of sea-level rise to shoreline mobility using coastal evolution modeling tools. The existing applications of these methods face two common difficulties: first, shoreline data are often lacking or insufficiently resolved temporally to capture the dynamics of coastlines; and second, relative sea level along the coast is generally only known in a limited number of areas where tide gauges are available. These two challenges can be met, owing to the increasing amount of shoreline change observations and complementary geodetic techniques. The wide range of different interpretations regarding the role of sea-level rise in recent shoreline changes highlights the necessity to conduct specific studies that rely on local observations and models applicable in the local geomorphological context.},

In these environments, sea-level rise will exacerbate coastal erosion to an amount which remains uncertain. Sandy shoreline change projections inherit the uncertainties of future mean sea-level changes, of vertical ground motions, and of other natural and anthropogenic processes affecting shoreline change variability and trends. Furthermore, the erosive impact of sea-level rise itself can be quantified using two fundamentally different models. Here, we show that this latter source of uncertainty, which has been little quantified so far, can account for 20 to 40\% of the variance of shoreline projections by 2100 and beyond. This is demonstrated for four contrasting sandy beaches that are relatively unaffected by human interventions in southwestern France, where a variance-based global sensitivity analysis of shoreline projection uncertainties can be performed owing to previous observations of beach profile and shoreline changes. This means that sustained coastal observations and efforts to develop sea-level rise impact models are needed to understand and eventually reduce uncertainties of shoreline change projections, in order to ultimately support coastal land-use planning and adaptation.},

Coastal zones are especially in need of climate services for adaptation, as they are increasingly threatened by sea level rise and its impacts, such as submergence, flooding, shoreline erosion, salinization and wetland change. In this paper, we examine how annual to multi-decadal sea level projections can be used within coastal climate services (CCS). To this end, we review the current state-of-the art of coastal climate services in the US, Australia and France, and identify lessons learned. More broadly, we also review current barriers in the development of CCS, and identify research and development efforts for overcoming barriers and facilitating their continued growth. The latter includes: (1) research in the field of sea level, coastal and adaptation science and (2) cross-cutting research in the area of user interactions, decision making, propagation of uncertainties and overall service architecture design. We suggest that standard approaches are required to translate relative sea level information into the forms required to inform the wide range of relevant decisions across coastal management, including coastal adaptation.},

  abstract = {The Australian Geoscience Data Cube (AGDC) aims to realise the full potential of Earth observation data holdings by addressing the Big Data challenges of volume, velocity, and variety that otherwise limit the usefulness of Earth observation data. There have been several iterations and AGDC version 2 is a major advance on previous work. The foundations and core components of the AGDC are: (1) data preparation, including geometric and radiometric corrections to Earth observation data to produce standardised surface reflectance measurements that support time-series analysis, and collection management systems which track the provenance of each Data Cube product and formalise re-processing decisions; (2) the software environment used to manage and interact with the data; and (3) the supporting high performance computing environment provided by the Australian National Computational Infrastructure (NCI). A growing number of examples demonstrate that our data cube approach allows analysts to extract rich new information from Earth observation time series, including through new methods that draw on the full spatial and temporal coverage of the Earth observation archives. To enable easy-uptake of the AGDC, and to facilitate future cooperative development, our code is developed under an open-source, Apache License, Version 2.0. This open-source approach is enabling other organisations, including the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites (CEOS), to explore the use of similar data cubes in developing countries.},

  abstract = {Sand nourishment is widely adopted as an effective soft approach to provide long-term coastal safety, protect the ecology environment, and promote tourism and recreation. With the increase in frequency and expenses in beach nourishment worldwide, an adequate prediction of morphology evolution is greatly desired for coastline management. Based on detailed monitoring data of the mega-nourishment Sand Engine, this article integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the nourishment morphology evolution. The historical surveyed data are transformed into sequence grids, which are input into the CNN to obtain the spatial features of beach nourishment. The CNN is constructed by performing the convolutional and pooling operation on the historical data, which can extract actual spatial features and reduce network complexity. The output of the CNN is input to LSTM to learn the temporal relationship to predict future nourishment terrain using past time-series features. Finally, the LSTM output is decoded by the fully connected layer to obtain the prediction result. The complex spatiotemporal correlations among the input data are identified through effective training of the proposed model. The major contribution of this article is to propose a data-driven model that combines CNN and LSTM for the morphology evolution prediction of beach nourishment, and validate the effectiveness of the proposed model by comparing with the performances of other popular methods in predicting the nourishment changes.},

  abstract = {While sea-level rise could flood and displace hundreds of millions of people, a range of studies have shown that adaptation in the form of coastal protection can be very effective and cost-efficient in reducing coastal impacts. All of these studies have, however, investigated adaptation decisions within one given sea-level rise and one given socio-economic scenario, which is at odds with the actual decision problem coastal planers are facing in that they need to decide across scenarios. This study takes first steps at filling this gap by assessing for which parts of the global coastline coastal protection is economically robust across 21st century global mean sea-level rise from 0.3 m to 2.0 m, the five Shared Socio-economic Pathways and discount rates from 0 to 6\%. We find that for 92,500 km of the global coastline it is economically robust to invest in protection (i.e. protection is cheaper than not protecting under every scenario considered). While these 92,500 km cover only 13\% of the global coastline, they account for 90\% of global coastal floodplain population and for 96\% of assets in the global coastal floodplain. For 451,000 km of the global coastline (65\%) covering 0.2\% of coastal floodplain population and 0.2\% of coastal floodplain assets globally, it is economically robust not to invest in protection. Our results suggest bifurcating coastal futures. On the one hand, richer, densely populated and urban areas are likely to be protected through higher and higher dikes. On the other hand, poorer rural areas will struggle to maintain safe human settlements and are likely to eventual retreat from the coast, raising difficult policy questions concerning transfer payments, compensation and liability for loss and damage.},

  abstract = {Feature pyramids are a basic component in recognition systems for detecting objects at different scales. But recent deep learning object detectors have avoided pyramid representations, in part because they are compute and memory intensive. In this paper, we exploit the inherent multi-scale, pyramidal hierarchy of deep convolutional networks to construct feature pyramids with marginal extra cost. A top-down architecture with lateral connections is developed for building high-level semantic feature maps at all scales. This architecture, called a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), shows significant improvement as a generic feature extractor in several applications. Using FPN in a basic Faster R-CNN system, our method achieves state-of-the-art single-model results on the COCO detection benchmark without bells and whistles, surpassing all existing single-model entries including those from the COCO 2016 challenge winners. In addition, our method can run at 5 FPS on a GPU and thus is a practical and accurate solution to multi-scale object detection. Code will be made publicly available.},

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build "fully convolutional" networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a novel architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20\% relative improvement to 62.2\% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes one third of a second for a typical image.},

  abstract = {Sand nourishments are presently widely applied to maintain or enhance coastal safety and beach width. Over the last decades, global sand nourishment volumes have increased greatly, and the demand for nourishments is anticipated to increase further in coming decades due to sea level rise. With the increase in nourishment size and the request for more complex nourishment shapes, an adequate prediction of the morphodynamic evolution is of major importance. Yet, neither the skill of current state-of-the-art models for such predictions nor the primary drivers that control the evolution are known. This article presents the results of a detailed numerical modelling study undertaken to examine the model skill and the processes governing the initial morphological response of the Sand Engine and the adjacent coastline. The process-based model Delft3D is used to hindcast the first year after completion of the mega-nourishment. The model reproduces measured water levels, velocities and nearshore waves well. The prediction of the morphological evolution is consistent with the measured evolution during the study period, with Brier Skill Scores in the ‘Excellent’ range. The model results clearly indicate that the sand eroded from the main peninsular section of the Sand Engine is deposited along adjacent north and south coastlines, accreting up to 6km of coastline within just one year. Analysis of model results further show that the erosional behaviour of the Sand Engine is linearly dependent on the cumulative wave energy of individual high energy wave events, with the duration of a storm event being more dominant than the maximum wave height occurring during the storm. The integrated erosion volume due to the 12 events with the highest cumulative wave energy density accounts for about 60\% of the total eroded volume of the peninsula, indicating that the less energetic wave events, with a higher probability of occurrence, are also important for the initial response of the Sand Engine. A structured model experiment using the verified Delft3D model indicates that wave forcing dominates the initial morphological response of the Sand Engine, accounting for approximately 75\% of the total erosion volume in the first year. The vertical tide is the second most important factor accounting for nearly 17\% of the total erosion volume, with surge, wind and horizontal tide playing only a minor role.},

  abstract = {Carolina Bays are oriented and sandy-rimmed depressions that are ubiquitous throughout the Atlantic Coastal Plain (ACP). Their origin has been a highly debated topic since the 1800s and remains unsolved. Past population estimates of Carolina Bays have varied vastly, ranging between as few as 10,000 to as many as 500,000. With such a large uncertainty around the actual population size, mapping these enigmatic features is a problem that requires an automated detection scheme. Using publicly available LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs) of the ACP as training images, various types of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were trained to detect Carolina bays. The detection results were assessed for accuracy and scalability, as well as analyzed for various morphologic, land-use and land cover, and hydrologic characteristics. Overall, the detector found over 23,000 Carolina Bays from southern New Jersey to northern Florida, with highest densities along interfluves. Carolina Bays in Delmarva were found to be smaller and shallower than Bays in the southeastern ACP. At least a third of Carolina Bays have been converted to agricultural lands and almost half of all Carolina Bays are forested. Few Carolina Bays are classified as open water basins, yet almost all of the detected Bays were within 2 km of a water body. In addition, field investigations based upon detection results were performed to describe the sedimentology of Carolina Bays. Sedimentological investigations showed that Bays typically have 1.5 m to 2.5 m thick sand rims that show a gradient in texture, with coarser sand at the bottom and finer sand and silt towards the top. Their basins were found to be 0.5 m to 2 m thick and showed a mix of clayey, silty, and sandy deposits. Last, the results compiled during this study were compared to similar depressional features (i.e., playa-lunette systems) to pinpoint any similarities in origin processes. Altogether, this study shows that CNNs are valuable tools for automated geomorphic feature detection and can lead to new insights when coupled with various forms of remotely sensed and field-based datasets.},

Subsequently, a detailed review is conducted to describe/discuss how DL has been applied for remote sensing image analysis tasks including image fusion, image registration, scene classification, object detection, land use and land cover (LULC) classification, segmentation, and object-based image analysis (OBIA). This review covers nearly every application and technology in the field of remote sensing, ranging from preprocessing to mapping.

  abstract = {Most of the worlds’ population relies on the processes and ecosystems in the coastal zone. Understanding the long-term change of coastlines is critical for the effective management of these complex, and heavily utilised regions. There has been a recent increase of studies focused on large-scale shoreline change mapping. However, most current methods are optimized for extracting shorelines of wave-dominated sandy beaches, which are only 30\% of the global coasts, resulting in uncertainty for other environments such as tidal flats and bedrock. Here, we propose a new shoreline change mapping workflow, using the Landsat archive and Google Earth Engine, which increases compute efficiency and is suitable for retrieving shoreline changes for various coastal landforms at high tide instead of mean sea level. By validating against regional and continental datasets in Australia, we found the approach here produced high mapping accuracy and showed particularly better performance at tide-dominated coasts, where tidal flats and intertidal bars and ridges are present, when compared to past approaches. This is an important step forward since tide-dominated and tide-modified coasts are widely distributed at tropical low latitudes. We also explored the global application of the proposed method and derived hotspots of shoreline erosion and accretion that agreed with multiple regional studies across the world. Most of these hotspots were related to river sediment discharge and human intervention on the coast, as expected. Although it requires further validation, the global application of our method demonstrates the significance of this approach in identifying potential threats to coastal zones, especially in complex tide-dominated environments, which can facilitate effective coastal management.},

  abstract = {Coastal geomorphic classification identifying the type of depositional environment, is an important indicator for coastal state and vulnerability, e.g., beach, bedrock and wetland (tidal flat and estuarine/delta/back-barrier depression). Accurate and current maps of these geomorphology classes from local (100 m-1 km) to global (105 km) scales are important for a range of objectives in the coastal zone. Previous methods to create coastal geomorphic maps relied heavily on manual efforts and expert opinions. However, these approaches are labour intensive and impractical for consistent application at a global scale, while still including local details. Existing global coastal geomorphology datasets are a compilation of different local-scale datasets, with varying spatial, categorical resolutions and accuracies. The recent availability of “big” and “open” data as well as increased processing capabilities resulted in the use of satellite images and digital elevation models to identify sandy beach and cliff separately. In our work, these raster data were processed on Google Earth Engine, combined with shape descriptors of coastline vectors and then fitted into machine learning models to classify the intertidal coastal geomorphology into bedrock, beach or wetland classes on the global scale (from 56◦ S to 60◦ N, excluding coral reef/fringing reef and fjord dominated coasts). A unique attribute of this new method was the incorporation of shape descriptors extracted from shoreline vector data, which substantially improved the classification accuracy. Using existing data from European Union (EU), the United States of America (US) and Australia for training and testing, the model achieved averaged 85\% accuracy for testing datasets in these continents and 84\% accuracy for 10,000 independent global validation samples beyond these continents. Successful classification was achieved for coasts dominated by a single geomorphology class, as well as more complex environments, such as headland bay and barrier island systems, where multiple classes appear next to each other. The model had relatively less confidence in coasts with sandy cliffs, tall canopy cover and engineered structures. Complete statistics from this study covering 56◦ S to 60◦ N showed 36.8\% (142,845 km) wetland, 26.7\% (103,762 km) beach and 36.5\% (141,579 km) bedrock. Beach and bedrock geomorphic classes were commonly detected at mid-latitudes (30o to 60o N/S), while wetland dominated tropical latitudes (0o to 30o N/S). The output dataset can be used for different coastal management purposes. The accuracy and categorical resolution of the classification can be further improved with the development of Earth Observation Big Data in the future.},

  abstract = {The Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) mission used laser altimetry measurements to determine changes in elevations of glaciers and ice sheets, as well as sea ice thickness distribution. These measurements have provided important information on the response of the cryopshere (Earth's frozen surfaces) to changes in atmosphere and ocean condition. ICESat operated from 2003 to 2009 and provided repeat altimetry measurements not only to the cryosphere scientific community but also to the ocean, terrestrial and atmospheric scientific communities. The conclusive assessment of significant ongoing rapid changes in the Earth's ice cover, in part supported by ICESat observations, has strengthened the need for sustained, high accuracy, repeat observations similar to what was provided by the ICESat mission. Following recommendations from the National Research Council for an ICESat follow-on mission, the ICESat-2 mission is now under development for planned launch in 2018. The primary scientific aims of the ICESat-2 mission are to continue measurements of sea ice freeboard and ice sheet elevation to determine their changes at scales from outlet glaciers to the entire ice sheet, and from 10s of meters to the entire polar oceans for sea ice freeboard. ICESat carried a single beam profiling laser altimeter that produced \textasciitilde 70 m diameter footprints on the surface of the Earth at \textasciitilde 150 m along-track intervals. In contrast, ICESat-2 will operate with three pairs of beams, each pair separated by about 3 km cross-track with a pair spacing of 90 m. Each of the beams will have a nominal 17 m diameter footprint with an along-track sampling interval of 0.7 m. The differences in the ICESat-2 measurement concept are a result of overcoming some limitations associated with the approach used in the ICESat mission. The beam pair configuration of ICESat-2 allows for the determination of local cross-track slope, a significant factor in measuring elevation change for the outlet glaciers surrounding the Greenland and Antarctica coasts. The multiple beam pairs also provide improved spatial coverage. The dense spatial sampling eliminates along-track measurement gaps, and the small footprint diameter is especially useful for sea surface height measurements in the often narrow leads needed for sea ice freeboard and ice thickness retrievals. The ICESat-2 instrumentation concept uses a low energy 532 nm (green) laser in conjunction with single-photon sensitive detectors to measure range. Combining ICESat-2 data with altimetry data collected since the start of the ICESat mission in 2003, such as Operation IceBridge and ESA's CryoSat-2, will yield a 15+ year record of changes in ice sheet elevation and sea ice thickness. ICESat-2 will also provide information of mountain glacier and ice cap elevations changes, land and vegetation heights, inland water elevations, sea surface heights, and cloud layering and optical thickness.},

  abstract = {We integrated the emerging information of the ecological, economic and social importance of the coasts at a global scale. We defined coastal regions to range from the continental shelf (to a depth of 200 m), the intertidal areas and adjacent land within 100 km of the coastline. We used the 1 km resolution Global Land Cover Characteristics Database and calculated the area covered by 11 different land cover classes (natural and human-altered ecosystems) within the 100 km limit [Burke, L., Kura, Y., Kasem, K., Revenga, C., Spalding, M., McAllister, D., 2001. Coastal Ecosystems. Washington DC World Resource Institute. 93 pp.]. Cover of aquatic ecosystems was calculated based on several world databases. Our results show that the coasts of the world comprise a wide variety of geomorphological characteristics of which mountainous coasts with a narrow shelf are the most abundant. Sandy shores are found on 16\% of the coastal countries. The coasts are located in every weather regime and the number of biomes is equally variable. Within the 100 km limit, 72\% still is covered by natural ecosystems and 28\% have been altered by human activities (urban and croplands). Open shrubs and evergreen broadleaf forests are the most abundant terrestrial ecosystems. Canada has the largest area of natural and relatively well preserved terrestrial ecosystems. Indonesia and China have the largest percentages of cropland area near the shore, and Japan and the US have the largest coastal urban areas. Indonesia, Australia, Brazil, Bahamas and New Caledonia have the largest areas of aquatic ecosystems. The calculated economic value of goods and services provided by coastal ecosystems showed that altogether, coastal ecosystems contribute 77\% of global ecosystem-services value calculated by Costanza et al. [Costanza, R., d'Arge, R., de Groot, R., Farber, S., Grasso, M., Hannon, B., Naeem, S., Limburg, K., Paruelo, J., O’Neill, R.V., Raskin, R., Sutton, P., ven den Belt, M., 1997. The value of the world’s ecosystem services and natural capital. Nature 387, 253–260]. According to 2003 data, 2.385 million people live within the coastal limit, which represents 41\% of world global population. More than 50\% of the coastal countries have from 80 to 100\% of their total population within 100 km of the coastline. Twenty-one of the 33 world's megacities are found on the coast. Multivariate analyses grouped coastal countries according to their ecological, economic and social characteristics. Three gradients explained 55\% of the variance: degree of conservation, ecosystem service product and demographic trends. Given the current scenario and the climate change prediction, the coastal environments will be confronting serious environmental issues that should be worked in advance, in order to achieve a sustainable development of the most valued locations of the world. Several recommendations are made.},

  abstract = {The concept of resilience has taken root in the discourse of environmental management, especially regarding Building with Nature strategies for embedding natural physical and ecological dynamics into engineered interventions in developed coastal zones. Resilience is seen as a desirable quality, and coastal management policy and practice are increasingly aimed at maximising it. Despite its ubiquity, resilience remains ambiguous and poorly defined in management contexts. What is coastal resilience? And what does it mean in settings where natural environmental dynamics have been supplanted by human-dominated systems? Here, we revisit the complexities of coastal resilience as a concept, a term, and a prospective goal for environmental management. We consider examples of resilience in natural and built coastal environments, and offer a revised, formal definition of coastal resilience with a holistic scope and emphasis on systemic functionality: “Coastal resilience is the capacity of the socioeconomic and natural systems in the coastal environment to cope with disturbances, induced by factors such as sea level rise, extreme events and human impacts, by adapting whilst maintaining their essential functions.” Against a backdrop of climate change impacts, achieving both socioeconomic and natural resilience in coastal environments in the long-term ({$>$}50 years) is very costly. Cost trade-offs among management aims and objectives mean that enhancement of socioeconomic resilience typically comes at the expense of natural resilience, and vice versa. We suggest that for practical purposes, optimising resilience might be a more realistic goal of coastal zone management.},

More sheltered sites experienced less erosion and one of the sites even experienced accretion due to beach rotation induced by alongshore sediment transport. Storm wave conditions such as were encountered during the 2013/2014 winter have the potential to dramatically change the equilibrium state (beach gradient, coastal alignment, and nearshore bar position) of beaches along the Atlantic coast of Europe.},

  abstract = {Settlements in coastal lowlands are especially vulnerable to risks resulting from climate change, yet these lowlands are densely settled and growing rapidly. In this paper, we undertake the first global review of the population and urban settlement patterns in the Low Elevation Coastal Zone (LECZ), defined here as the contiguous area along the coast that is less than 10 metres above sea level. Overall, this zone covers 2 per cent of the world's land area but contains 10 per cent of the world's population and 13 per cent of the world's urban population. A disproportionate number of the countries with a large share of their population in this zone are small island countries, but most of the countries with large populations in the zone are large countries with heavily populated delta regions. On average, the Least Developed Countries have a higher share of their population living in the zone (14 per cent) than do OECD countries (10 per cent), with even greater disparities in the urban shares (21 per cent compared to 11 per cent). Almost two-thirds of urban settlements with populations greater than 5 million fall, at least partly, in the zone. In some countries (most notably China), urbanization is driving a movement in population towards the coast. Reducing the risk of disasters related to climate change in coastal settlements will require a combination of mitigation, migration and settlement modification.},

These models are forced with concentrations of greenhouse gases and other constituents derived from various emissions scenarios ranging from non-mitigation scenarios to idealised long-term scenarios. In general, we assess non-mitigated projections of future climate change at scales from global to hundreds of kilometres. Further assessments of regional and local climate changes are provided in Chapter 11. Due to an unprecedented, joint effort by many modelling groups worldwide, climate change projections are now based on multi-model means, differences between models can be assessed quantitatively and in some instances, estimates of the probability of change of important climate system parameters complement expert judgement. New results corroborate those given in the Third Assessment Report (TAR). Continued greenhouse gas emissions at or above current rates will cause further warming and induce many changes in the global climate system during the 21st century that would very likely be larger than those observed during the 20th century.},

  abstract = {Coastal zones have large social, economic and environmental values. They are more densely populated than the hinterland and concentrate large economic assets, critical infrastructures and human activities such as tourism, fisheries, navigation. Furthermore, coastal oceans are home to a wealth of living marine resources and very productive ecosystems. Yet, coastal zones are exposed to various natural and anthropogenic hazards. To reduce the risks associated with marine hazards, sustained coastal zone monitoring programs, forecasting and early warning systems are increasingly needed. Earth observations (EO), and in particular satellite remote sensing, provide invaluable information: satellite-borne sensors allow an effective monitoring of the quasi-global ocean, with synoptic views of large areas, good spatial and temporal resolution, and sustained time-series covering several years to decades. However, satellite observations do not always meet the precision required by users, in particular in dynamic coastal zones, characterized by shorter-scale variability. A variety of sensors are used to directly monitor the coastal zone and their observations can also be integrated into numerical models to provide a full 4D monitoring of the ocean and forecasts. Here, we review how EO, and more particularly satellite observations, can monitor coastal hazards and their drivers. These include coastal flooding, shoreline changes, maritime security, marine pollution, water quality, and marine ecology shifts on the one hand, and several physical characteristics (bathymetry, topography, vertical land motion) of coastal zones, meteorological and oceanic (metocean) variables that can act as forcing factors for coastal hazards on the other hand.},

Primarily due to ocean thermal expansion and transfer from land ice (glaciers, ice sheets) to the ocean, sea-level rise is therefore an integrated indicator of climate change. Coastal zones and communities are expected to be increasingly threatened by sea level changes, with various adverse and widespread impacts. The European Union’s Earth Observation Programmed, Copernicus, monitors our planet and its environment, for the ultimate benefit of society. This includes the monitoring of sea level changes and the provision of ancillary fields needed to assess sea-level rise coastal risks, to guide adaptation and to support related policies and directives. Copernicus is organized with a space component, including dedicated Earth Observation satellites (Sentinel missions), and services, which transform the wealth of satellite, in situ and integrated numerical model information into added-value datasets and information usable by scientists, managers and decision-makers, and the wider public. Here, an overview of the Copernicus products and services to inform on sea level rise adaptation is provided. Perspectives from Copernicus services on future evolutions to better inform on coastal sea level rise, associated risks, and support adaptation are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Data fusion is a prevalent way to deal with imperfect raw data for capturing reliable, valuable and accurate information. Comparing with a range of classical probabilistic data fusion techniques, machine learning method that automatically learns from past experiences without explicitly programming, remarkably renovates fusion techniques by offering the strong ability of computing and predicting. Nevertheless, the literature still lacks a thorough review of the recent advances of machine learning for data fusion. Therefore, it is beneficial to review and summarize the state of the art in order to gain a deep insight on how machine learning can benefit and optimize data fusion. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on data fusion methods based on machine learning. We first offer a detailed introduction to the background of data fusion and machine learning in terms of definitions, applications, architectures, processes, and typical techniques. Then, we propose a number of requirements and employ them as criteria to review and evaluate the performance of existing fusion methods based on machine learning. Through the literature review, analysis and comparison, we finally come up with a number of open issues and propose future research directions in this field.},

For the end of the century, results show a significant increase up to 30\% in 100 year return level WEF for the majority of the coastal areas of the southern temperate zone, while in the Northern Hemisphere large coastal areas are characterized by a significant negative trend. We show that the most significant long-term trends of extreme WEF can be explained by intensification of teleconnection patterns such as the Antarctic Oscillation, El Niño–Southern Oscillation, and North Atlantic Oscillation. The projected changes will have broad implications for ocean engineering applications and disaster risk management. Especially low-lying coastal countries in the Southern Hemisphere will be particularly vulnerable due to the combined effects of projected relative sea level rise and more extreme wave activities.},

This tenfold increase in the rate of rise can be attributed to climate change through the melting of land ice and the thermal expansion of ocean water. As the present warming trend is expected to continue, global mean sea level will continue to rise. Here we review recent insights into past sea-level changes on decadal to millennial timescales and how they may help constrain future changes. We find that most studies constrain global mean sea-level rise to less than one metre over the twenty-first century, but departures from this global mean could reach several decimetres in many areas. We conclude that improving estimates of the spatial variability in future sea-level change is an important research target in coming years.},

This study focuses on shoreline extraction and shoreline evolution using high spatial resolution satellite images in the presence of foam. A multispectral supervised classification technique is selected, namely the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and applied with three classes which are land, foam and water. The merging of water and foam classes followed by a segmentation procedure enables the separation of land and ocean pixels. The performance of the method is evaluated using a validation dataset acquired on two study areas (south and north of the bay of Senda\&iuml;\&mdash;Japan). On each site, WorldView-2 multispectral images (eight bands, 2 m resolution) were acquired before and after the Fukushima tsunami generated by the Tohoku earthquake in 2011. The consideration of the foam class enables the false negative error to be reduced by a factor of three. The SVM method is also compared with four other classification methods, namely Euclidian Distance, Spectral Angle Mapper, Maximum Likelihood, and Neuronal Network. The SVM method appears to be the most efficient to determine the erosion and the accretion resulting from the tsunami, which are societal issues for littoral management purposes.},

  abstract = {The Coastal Fluvial Flood (CFFlood) model for assessing coastal and fluvial flood impacts under current and future climate and socio-economic conditions is presented and applied at the European scale. Flood frequency is estimated as a function of river flows, extreme sea levels and estimated defence standards to determine the flood extent and depth. Flood consequences are estimated by combining the latter with information on urban areas, population density and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Climate and socio-economic scenarios and possible adaptation choices are included to analyse future conditions. In 2010, almost 6~\% of the European population is estimated to live in the 100~year flood area. The corresponding economic loss is €236 billion, assuming no defences. Estimated flood protection reduces economic damage substantially by 67 to 99~\% and the number of people flooded is reduced by 37 to 99~\% for the 100~year event. Impact simulations show that future climate and socio-economic conditions may increase flood impacts, especially in coastal areas due to sea-level rise. In contrast, impacts caused by fluvial flooding sometimes decrease, especially in southern and western regions of Europe due to decreases in precipitation and consequent run-off. Under high-end scenarios, flood impacts increase substantially unless there are corresponding adaptation efforts.},

  abstract = {Beaches around the world continuously adjust to daily and seasonal changes in wave and tide conditions, which are themselves changing over longer time-scales. Different approaches to predict multi-year shoreline evolution have been implemented; however, robust and reliable predictions of shoreline evolution are still problematic even in short-term scenarios (shorter than decadal). Here we show results of a modelling competition, where 19 numerical models (a mix of established shoreline models and machine learning techniques) were tested using data collected for Tairua beach, New Zealand with 18 years of daily averaged alongshore shoreline position and beach rotation (orientation) data obtained from a camera system. In general, traditional shoreline models and machine learning techniques were able to reproduce shoreline changes during the calibration period (1999–2014) for normal conditions but some of the model struggled to predict extreme and fast oscillations. During the forecast period (unseen data, 2014–2017), both approaches showed a decrease in models’ capability to predict the shoreline position. This was more evident for some of the machine learning algorithms. A model ensemble performed better than individual models and enables assessment of uncertainties in model architecture. Research-coordinated approaches (e.g., modelling competitions) can fuel advances in predictive capabilities and provide a forum for the discussion about the advantages/disadvantages of available models.},

  abstract = {Understanding the interactions between dune systems and beaches is critical to determining the short-term shoreline response and the long-term resilience. In this study, almost 15 years of monthly beach/dune measurements were analyzed for three different profiles at Vougot Beach, France to understand and predict shoreline changes from intra-annual to multi-annual time-scales. Four migration modes: advance/retreat (translation modes) and steepening/flattening (rotation modes) were identified through a centroid analysis. The analysis showed that translation and rotation can occur simultaneously, with long-term trends of beach retreat and profile steepening (lower beach retreating and upper beach advancing), which was interrupted by two energetic wave events causing profile flattening (lower beach advancing and upper beach retreating). These two observations are evidence of how the sediment contribution resulting from the dune erosion events temporarily caused a large advance in the shoreline position. A recent modeling approach that accounts for different time-scales is applied to predict the shoreline changes, showing significant improvements in comparison to a traditional shoreline equilibrium model when time-scales related with the dune erosion and recovery are considered. The results showed that the dune system affects the beach profile evolution both spatially, with different impacts at different elevations along the cross-shore profile, and temporally, by periodically redistributing the sediment in the system.},

These techniques, used to measure shoreline erosion, barrier island migration, and dune erosion, vary in approach, accuracy, expense and training/time requirements. Some of the more recent coastal mapping techniques apply advances in cartography and photogrammetry providing high-resolution measurements with less error than manual methods that use a photographic comparator or stereo zoom transfer scope. However, such techniques are expensive, require extensive training, and may take longer than manual methods. While many coastal mapping studies would benefit from these advanced techniques, not all studies require the high resolution these more recent techniques offer. When beginning a coastal mapping project or choosing to upgrade laboratory facilities, researching established coastal mapping techniques before choosing from among them requires extensive literature review. To assist researchers, engineers and planners who wish to undertake a coastal mapping project, this paper provides an overview of the errors associated with shoreline mapping, and a discussion of factors to be considered when selecting a coastal mapping technique.},

  abstract = {Accumulation of fat, oil and grease (FOG) in the sumps of wastewater pumping stations is a common failure cause for these facilities. Floating solids are often not transported by the pump suction inlets and the individual solids can accumulate to stiff and thick FOG layers. The lack of data about the dynamics in FOG layer formation still hampers the design of effective measures towards its mitigation. In this article, we present a low-cost camera-based automated system for the observation of FOG layer dynamics in wastewater pumping stations at high-frequency (minutes) over extended time windows (months). Optical imagery is processed through a deeplearning computer vision routine that allows describing FOG layer dynamics (e.g. accumulation rate and changes in shape) and various hydraulic processes in the pump sump (e.g. the water level, surface flow velocity fields, vorticity, or circulation). Furthermore, the system can perform in-camera image processing, thus allowing the transfer of compressed-processed datasets when deployed in remote locations (Edge AI computing), which could be of great utility for the hydro-ecological monitoring community. In this study, the technology applied is illustrated with a dataset (six months, two-minute frequency) collected at a wastewater pumping station at the municipality of Rotterdam, The Netherlands. This monitoring system represents a source of information for the management of (waste)water pumping stations (e.g. detection of free-surface vortices and scheduling of sump cleaning operations) and facilitates the collection of standardized high-frequency FOG layer dynamics data for a detailed description of FOG build-up and transport processes.},

Here we present the first global reanalysis of storm surges and extreme sea levels (GTSR data set) based on hydrodynamic modelling. GTSR covers the entire world's coastline and consists of time series of tides and surges, and estimates of extreme sea levels. Validation shows that there is good agreement between modelled and observed sea levels, and that the performance of GTSR is similar to that of many regional hydrodynamic models. Due to the limited resolution of the meteorological forcing, extremes are slightly underestimated. This particularly affects tropical cyclones, which requires further research. We foresee applications in assessing flood risk and impacts of climate change. As a first application of GTSR, we estimate that 1.3\% of the global population is exposed to a 1 in 100-year flood.},

We present a novel global dataset of extreme sea levels, the Coastal Dataset for the Evaluation of Climate Impact (CoDEC), which can be used to accurately map the impact of climate change on coastal regions around the world. The third generation Global Tide and Surge Model (GTSM), with a coastal resolution of 2.5 km (1.25 km in Europe), was used to simulate extreme sea levels for the ERA5 climate reanalysis from 1979 to 2017, as well as for future climate scenarios from 2040 to 2100. The validation against observed sea levels demonstrated a good performance, and the annual maxima had a mean bias (MB) of -0.04 m, which is 50\% lower than the MB of the previous GTSR dataset. By the end of the century (2071–2100), it is projected that the 1 in 10-year water levels will have increased 0.34 m on average for RCP4.5, while some locations may experience increases of up to 0.5 m. The change in return levels is largely driven by SLR, although at some locations changes in storms surges and interaction with tides amplify the impact of SLR with changes up to 0.2 m. By presenting an application of the CoDEC dataset to the city of Copenhagen, we demonstrate how climate impact indicators derived from simulation can contribute to an understanding of climate impact on a local scale. Moreover, the CoDEC output locations are designed to be used as boundary conditions for regional models, and we envisage that they will be used for dynamic downscaling.},

Machine learning provides these, developing methods that can automatically detect patterns in data and then use the uncovered patterns to predict future data. This textbook offers a comprehensive and self-contained introduction to the field of machine learning, based on a unified, probabilistic approach.The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost all the models described have been implemented in a MATLAB software package—PMTK (probabilistic modeling toolkit)—that is freely available online. The book is suitable for upper-level undergraduates with an introductory-level college math background and beginning graduate students.},

We developed a global analysis of satellite data to simultaneously monitor change in three highly interconnected intertidal ecosystem types—tidal flats, tidal marshes, and mangroves—from 1999 to 2019. Globally, 13,700 square kilometers of tidal wetlands have been lost, but these have been substantially offset by gains of 9700 km               2               , leading to a net change of −4000 km               2               over two decades.

  abstract = {Australia has a vast, diverse and dynamic shoreline, and national perspectives on the mechanisms, magnitude and trajectories of coastal adjustment are required to underpin informed management. Geoscience Australia’s national Digital Earth Australia Coastlines (DEA Coastlines) was developed to help address this need. These datasets were derived by the application of sub-pixel analysis techniques to the Landsat archive to provide annual coastal contours for the years 1988–2019, and accompanying national point datasets provide change statistics at two scales (30 m and 5 km alongshore spacing). This study examines the utility of these three datasets for understanding temporal and spatial patterns of geomorphic change for representative case examples around Australia. These examples have been selected to demonstrate DEA Coastlines capability for examining the dy­ namics of Australia’s diverse shorelines, from the mangrove-fringed, macrotidal systems of north-western Australia to the microtidal clastic barrier systems of the south-east. We examine this capability at tertiary to sub-tertiary coastal compartment (TCC; sediment cell) spatial scales. While some TCC are strongly and consis­ tently net-progradational or net-erosional, most TCC demonstrate alongshore variations in trajectories and rates of change. We use these patterns of change to infer sub-TCC sediment pathways, and examine the temporal trends contained within representative point datasets to link changes to known process drivers. DEA Coastlines also captures diminishing widths of coastal barriers and has the potential to be combined with more detailed site analyses to forecast future trajectories of change. There are, however, some limitations to DEA Coastlines. Owing to the annual scale of the analysis used to develop the datasets, rapidly moving intertidal bars can introduce considerable error, and an uncertainty field successfully flags most of these locations. Other overlapping and complex coastline contours can sometimes be unpacked into more discrete phases to provide a richer under­ standing of non-linear coastal trends, and these examples highlight the need to simultaneously consider both of the DEA Coastlines 30 m point statistic and contour datasets. The Australian DEA Coastlines dataset thus pro­ vides nationally consistent perspectives for improved coastal management, and has been made freely available online to support a broad range of end users. While these datasets are presently exclusive to the Australian coast, the approach also lends itself to future application to the global Landsat archive.},

  abstract = {Increasing human pressures on coastlines and associated threats posed by sea-level rise have stimulated development of a range of different concepts and methodological approaches to assess coastal vulnerability. The first section of this paper summarizes the concepts associated with vulnerability, natural hazards and climate change. The most widely adopted analytical approaches to vulnerability assessment are described, including spatial scales, the need for hybrid approaches comprising both biophysical and social dimensions of vulnerability, and the gradual incorporation of resilience aspects into such methodologies. In particular, the development and application of vulnerability indices is examined, based on a review of more than 50 studies that applied such indices across a range of hazards. The analytical procedures, proposed typologies, and most commonly selected variables are discussed. This overview demonstrates the breadth of vulnerability studies. This leads inevitably to lack of standardization of concepts and assumptions, which results in limited comparability between outputs for coasts from different areas. However, the widespread demand for vulnerability assessment as a component of decision-making in integrated management of the coast justifies pursuing indicator-based vulnerability assessments. In some cases these will explicitly adopt a consistent methodology that enables comparison between sites, whereas alternatively, metrics may be developed that are designed around particular system components and the site-specific functions for which they are valued.},

Although this affects local rates of sea-level rise, assessments of the coastal impacts of subsidence are lacking on a global scale. Here, we quantify global-mean relative sea-level rise to be 2.6\,mm\,yr−1 over the past two decades. However, as coastal inhabitants are preferentially located in subsiding locations, they experience an average relative sea-level rise up to four times faster at 7.8 to 9.9\,mm\,yr−1. These results indicate that the impacts and adaptation needs are much higher than reported global sea-level rise measurements suggest. In particular, human-induced subsidence in and surrounding coastal cities can be rapidly reduced with appropriate policy for groundwater utilization and drainage. Such policy would offer substantial and rapid benefits to reduce growth of coastal flood exposure due to relative sea-level rise.},

  abstract = {Global-mean sea-level rise will drive impacts and adaptation needs around the world's coasts over the 21st century and beyond. A key element in assessing these issues is the development of scenarios (or plausible futures) of local relative sea-level rise to support impact assessment and adaptation planning. This requires combining a number of different but uncertain components of sea level which can be linked to climatic and non-climatic (i.e., uplift/subsidence of coastal land) factors. A major concern remains about the possibility of significant contributions from the major Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and this must be factored into the assessments, despite the uncertainty. This paper reviews the different mechanisms which contribute to sea-level change and considers a methodology for combining the available data to create relative (or local) sea-level rise scenarios suitable for impact and adaptation assessments across a range of sophistication of analysis. The methods that are developed are pragmatic and consider the different needs of impact assessment, adaptation planning, and long-term decision making. This includes the requirements of strategic decision makers who rightly focus on low probability but high consequence changes and their consequences. Hence plausible high end sea-level rise scenarios beyond the conventional Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) range and which take into account evidence beyond that from the current generation of climate models are developed and their application discussed. Continued review and development of sea-level scenarios is recommended, starting with assimilating the insights of the forthcoming IPCC AR5 assessment.

Natural and human-made threats, however, pose a major risk to CI. Therefore, geospatial data on the location of CI are fundamental for in-depth risk analyses, which are required to inform policy decisions aiming to reduce risk. We present a first-of-its-kind globally harmonized spatial dataset for the representation of CI. In this study, we: (1) collect and harmonize detailed geospatial data of the world’s main CI systems into a single geospatial database; and (2) develop the Critical Infrastructure Spatial Index (CISI) to express the global spatial intensity of CI. The CISI aggregates high-resolution geospatial OpenStreetMap (OSM) data of 39 CI types that are categorized under seven overarching CI systems. The detailed geospatial data are rasterized into a harmonized and consistent dataset with a resolution of 0.10\,×\,0.10 and 0.25\,×\,0.25 degrees. The dataset can be applied to explore the current landscape of CI, identify CI hotspots, and as exposure input for large-scale risk assessments.},

To clearly identify coastal vulnerabilities and develop appropriate adaptation strategies due to projected increased levels of coastal flooding and erosion, coastal managers need local-scale hazards projections using the best available climate and coastal science. In collaboration with leading scientists world-wide, the USGS designed the Coastal Storm Modeling System (CoSMoS) to assess the coastal impacts of climate change for the California coast, including the combination of sea-level rise, storms, and coastal change. In this project, we directly address the needs of coastal resource managers in Southern California by integrating a vast range of global climate change projections in a thorough and comprehensive numerical modeling framework. In Part 1 of a two-part submission on CoSMoS, methods and the latest improvements are discussed, and an example of hazard projections is presented.},

SHOREX was designed as a set of separated tools that have been integrated within a single python framework to be used even in production environments. The workflow can be separated into three phases: (1) downloading, (2) pre-processing and (3) processing, being the first step the most time consuming. For the downloading process, the usage of servers like Amazon S3 has been a great help. The internal structure of this server allows downloading both Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images separated by tiles or scenes and bands, rather than all bands in a single file. That involves higher flexibility and less time of process. The preprocessing phase consists of a range of tasks like conversion between image formats, clipping, TOA reflectance conversion, cloud filtering or band sub-pixel geo-referencing. Once all images are prepared, they are processed using SHOREX, being the result a point shapefile layer organized by date with some statistical attribute fields. This statistical information can be useful to detect potential anomalies or analyze special dynamics on the coast related with climate phenomena or direct human action.},

  abstract = {The interaction between storm surges and inland runoff has been gaining increasing attention recently, as they have the potential to result in compound floods. In Europe, several flood events of this type have been recorded in the past century in Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy and United Kingdom. Here, we investigate the probability of joint occurrence of storm surges, precipitation, river discharges and waves. A coincidence of those factors have a potential to cause compound 5 floods. We use several datasets covering most of Europe, including observations and data from the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS), ERA-Interim climate reanalysis and a regional climate model within the CORDEX framework, and carry out a statistical analysis based on copulas to assess the likelihood of joint occurrence. Further, we synthesize the joint probability of occurrence of extreme compound events, and their intensity, in the form of a composite index, thus identifying areas where compound floods could be of most concern. The results show considerable regional differences in dependency structure and 10 the resulting joint probability of extreme surge, precipitation and river discharge events. In southern Europe the probability of joint occurrence of storm surge and precipitation is relatively high due to significant flash flood hazard. In northern Europe, along the main corridor of winter storms, dependency between surges and river discharges is higher than elsewhere, with large differences between west-facing and east-facing coasts. The occurrence of compound floods in most of the Nordic countries and along the Black Sea is very unlikely. The results allow the identification of areas at risk from compound flooding. Future 15 studies that utilize statistical and physical methods are recommended to assess interactions between surges and inland runoff at a local scale.},

  abstract = {Coastal erosion is a major issue facing Europe that will only worsen under future climate change and the resulting sea level rise. One effect of erosion is the loss of ecosystem services, which are provided by coastal areas, such as provisioning, regulating, habitat, and cultural services. These services can be quantified in monetary terms. Here, we present comprehensive estimates of future decline in coastal ecosystem services due to the erosion of sandy coastlines. We used datasets derived from remote sensing products: a pan-European land cover/use dataset (Corine Land Cover) and new global probabilistic coastal erosion projections constrained by artificial and topographical barriers to erosion. The results include historical changes (2000–2018) and projections under two emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for 2050 and 2100 together with uncertainty bounds. We estimate that in 2018, the coastal zone (excluding open sea) included 579,700 km2 of habitats generating 494 billion euros of services annually. The future sea-level rise could erode 1.0\% [90\% confidence interval 0.7–1.5\%] of the 2018 area under RCP4.5, and 1.2\% [0.7–2.2\%] under RCP8.5. The decline in services would be even greater: 4.2\% [3.0–6.1\%] under RCP4.5, and 5.1\% [3.3–8.5\%] under RCP8.5. The highest absolute losses would be sustained by salt marshes, while relative losses would be highest in beaches, sands, and dunes. The most affected countries in relative economic terms would be Denmark, Albania, Greece, Estonia, and Finland, but countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, and France would be among those losing the largest share of their coastal ecosystem services. Regional analysis using NUTS 3 regions shows high diversity of the impacts, with many regions along the North Sea and eastern Mediterranean Sea that are heavily affected by coastal erosion-induced loss of ecosystem services. The study highlights the urgency of undertaking mitigation actions.},

  abstract = {The interaction between storm surges and inland run-off has been gaining increasing attention recently, as they have the potential to result in compound floods. In Europe, several flood events of this type have been recorded in the past century in Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy and UK. First projections of compound flood hazard under climate change have been made, but no study has so far analysed whether existing, independent climate and hydrodynamic models are able to reproduce the co-occurrence of storm surges, precipitation, river discharges or waves. Here, we investigate the dependence between the different drivers in different observational and modelled data set, utilizing gauge records and high-resolution outputs of climate reanalyses and hindcasts, hydrodynamic models of European coasts and rivers. The results show considerable regional differences in strength of the dependence in surge–precipitation and surge–discharge pairs. The models reproduce those dependencies, and the time lags between the flood drivers, rather well in north-western Europe, but less successfully in the southern part. Further, we identified several compound flood events in the reanalysis data. We were able to link most of those modelled events with historical reports of flood or storm losses. However, false positives and false negatives were also present in the reanalysis and several large compound floods were missed by the reanalysis. All in all, the study still shows that accurate representation of compound floods by independent models of each driver is possible, even if not yet achievable at every location.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this book is to provide the reader with the knowledge required to carry out the  most accurate tidal analysis and tidal prediction possible using any set of water level or current data  that he or she may have available. The book is also intended to provide the reader with tools to  interpret the analysis results with respect to the hydrodynamics (the physics of the water movement)  of the bay or ocean from which the data were obtained, so that these results can best be used for  particular oceanographic applications. Tidal analysis and prediction involves more than simply  running a harmonic analysis program to obtain tidal harmonic constants and then putting them in  a tidal prediction program. It requires understanding both the astronomical and the hydrodynamic  aspects of the tide. Lack of such an understanding can lead to problems when performing a tidal  analysis. A few examples of such problems are very briefly mentioned below (they are explained  in more detail later in this book, and the technical terms used below are defined in Chapter 2).  It is the astronomy, namely the relative periodic motions of the earth, moon, and sun, that  determines the frequencies at which tidal energy is found. The contribution to the tide by the energy  at each tidal frequency is usually represented by a tidal harmonic constituent, for which there will  be an amplitude and a phase lag. The pairs of amplitudes and phase lags are referred to as harmonic  constants. Which of these tidal constituents can be included in a harmonic analysis depends on the  length of the data times series one has available. The longer the time series the more tidal  constituents that can be included in the analysis and the more accurate the tidal predictions will be.  Attempting to include in the analysis more tidal constituents than can be resolved with the available  length of the time series can lead to erroneous results, or even to no results at all because in such  cases numerical instability can cause the harmonic analysis program to fail ( “blow up”). Even when  the appropriate tidal constituents are included in a harmonic analysis, one must remember that the  energy of the tidal constituents that could not be included in the harmonic analysis (because they  were too close in frequency to other larger tidal constituents) will still affect the constituents that  were included in the analysis. As a result one may see errors, namely, differences between the tide  predictions and the actual water level data, that slowly oscillate in time due to the missing tidal  constituents. Such errors may be significant if one has analyzed only 15 days of data or even 29  days.  It is the hydrodynamics of the ocean and bay that determines how large the tide or tidal current  will be at a particular location, as well as the timing of high and low waters, maximum floods and  ebbs, and slack waters. In shallow water the hydrodynamics becomes nonlinear, distorting the tide  and adding new higher harmonic tidal constituents (overtides) and new tidal constituents within the  semidiurnal tidal band (compound tides), some with the same frequencies as some of the original  astronomically caused tidal constituents. Knowing whether an analyzed constituent is a compound  Tidal Analysis and Prediction  2  tidal constituent or an astronomical tidal constituent (with the same frequency) can make a  difference in the accuracy of the subsequent tide predictions, especially when making predictions  for years other than the year whose data was used for the analysis.  Shallow-water hydrodynamics also causes nonlinear interactions between the tide and nontidal  phenomena such as river flow and wind-produced changes in water level (storm surges) and  currents. For example, high river flow reduces the tide range and distorts the tide curve (modifying  the astronomical tidal constituents and adding additional higher harmonic constituents, the  overtides). And so, if water level data obtained during a time period with high river flow are  analyzed and then tide predictions are made using the harmonic constants derived from those data,  the predicted high waters will be too small throughout the rest of the year. Likewise data obtained  during strong wind events may have tides that are modified by low-frequency storm surge and thus  are not representative of the rest of the year.  In most cases water level or current data are only available at a few distinct locations in a bay  or along a coast. Often some of these locations have data times series that are not long enough to  allow a useful harmonic analysis, so oceanographers developed other ways to extract tidal  information from locations with short data time series. For decades this has been done  nonharmonically, by simply comparing the high and low waters in water level data from the short  stations (usually called subordinate stations, or secondary ports) with the high and low waters in  predictions harmonically derived from longer stations (usually called reference stations, or standard  ports). However, there can be severe limitations on how well this can work, due to the  hydrodynamics of the location where the data were obtained.  Although this book provides some “rules of thumb” for carrying out tidal analysis and  prediction, the intent is to go well beyond this. This book explains not just the “how” but also the  “why”, namely it provides explanations of the astronomical causes of the tide and the hydrodynamic  modifications of the tide, so the reader can determine how to maximize the accuracy of the analysis  results and predictions. This understanding is also important for interpreting the analysis results.  This book explains and illustrates all state-of-the-art tidal analysis and prediction methods  presently in use, as well as the astronomical, hydrodynamic, and statistical theories behind them.  This is not intended to be a complete textbook on tides. The emphasis here is on subjects the reader  must understand in order to carry out accurate tidal analyses and to make skillful tidal predictions.  However, in meeting this objective, the result is a reasonably complete study of the tides (with  references for subjects not covered in detail). The book provides practical operational procedures,  including considerations related to maximum analysis accuracy and maximum prediction skill.  The book is written at an introductory level, so that the reader should need little background in  tidal or oceanographic theory. With an eye toward the teaching aspects of this book, it begins with  a general overview of the subject of tides, so that the reader can first see the big picture. Then as  the material becomes more detailed, the reader will be able to understand that material within a  larger context. Since the astronomical and hydrodynamic aspects of the subject affect each other,  it was felt that such an overview should be given first, rather than simply jumping right into detailed  astronomical theory followed by detailed hydrodynamic theory. Because of this approach, there  may occasionally be some redundancy, as well as frequent references to other sections in the book.  Although this book is written at a level accessible to the nonexpert, it is also hoped that tidal experts  will still find of interest some of the topics that they may not have dealt with themselves.},

Recent decades have witnessed exponential growth in the volume of new scientific and technological knowledge, thereby creating conditions that should be ripe for major advances8,9. Yet contrary to this view, studies suggest that progress is slowing in several major fields10,11. Here, we analyse these claims at scale across six decades, using data on 45\,million papers and 3.9\,million patents from six large-scale datasets, together with a new quantitative metric—the CD index12—that characterizes how papers and patents change networks of citations in science and technology. We find that papers and patents are increasingly less likely to break with the past in ways that push science and technology in new directions. This pattern holds universally across fields and is robust across multiple different citation- and text-based metrics1,13–17. Subsequently, we link this decline in disruptiveness to a narrowing in the use of previous knowledge, allowing us to reconcile the patterns we observe with the ‘shoulders of giants’ view. We find that the observed declines are unlikely to be driven by changes in the quality of published science, citation practices or field-specific factors. Overall, our results suggest that slowing rates of disruption may reflect a fundamental shift in the nature of science and technology.},

  abstract = {In 2001, the U.S. Geological Survey began conducting scientific assessments of coastal vulnerability to potential future sea- and lake-level changes in 22 National Park Service sea- and lakeshore units. Coastal park units chosen for the assessment included a variety of geological and physical settings along the U.S. Atlantic, Pacific, Gulf of Mexico, Gulf of Alaska, Caribbean, and Great Lakes shorelines. This research is motivated by the need to understand and anticipate coastal changes caused by accelerating sea-level rise, as well as lake-level changes caused by climate change, over the next century. The goal of these assessments is to provide information that can be used to make long-term (decade to century) management decisions. Here we analyze the results of coastal vulnerability assessments for several coastal national park units. Index-based assessments quantify the likelihood that physical changes may occur based on analysis of the following variables: tidal range, ice cover, wave height, coastal slope, historical shoreline change rate, geomorphology, and historical rate of relative sea- or lake-level change. This approach seeks to combine a coastal system's susceptibility to change with its natural ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions, and it provides a measure of the system's potential vulnerability to the effects of sea- or lake-level change. Assessments for 22 park units are combined to evaluate relationships among the variables used to derive the index. Results indicate that Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico parks have the highest vulnerability rankings relative to other park regions. A principal component analysis reveals that 99\% of the index variability can be explained by four variables: geomorphology, regional coastal slope, water-level change rate, and mean significant wave height. Tidal range, ice cover, and historical shoreline change are not as important when the index is evaluated at large spatial scales (thousands of kilometers).},

Dependence and correlation may differ substantially from one another since dependence is focused heavily on tail (extreme) percentiles.

  abstract = {In this Report, the possibility of utilizing joint probability methods in coastal flood hazard component calculations is investigated, since flood risk is rarely a function of just one source variable but usually more of two or three variables such as river discharge, storm surge, wave etc. Joint probability values provide the likelihood of source variables taking high values simultaneously and resulting to a situation where flooding may occur. This report focuses on data preparation, parameter selection and methodology application. The source variable-pairs presented here, which include enough information for calculations, are: (i) surge \& wave, (ii) surge \& discharge and (iii) wave \& discharge. The analysis is focused over 32 river ending (RIEN) points that have been selected to cover a variety of coastal environments along European riverine and estuary areas. In the absence of coincident long-term measurements, the methodology of simulating data observations by modelling was adapted resulting to a set of hindcasts for the three source variables (surge, wave height and discharge). Storm surge hindcasts were performed by utilising the hydrodynamic model Delft3D-Flow that was forced by wind and pressure terms from ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis. In a similar way, wave hindcasts were generated by utilizing the latest version of ECMWF ECWAM wave (stand-alone) model, forced by neutral wind terms from ERA-Interim. For the construction of river discharge hindcasts the LISFLOOD model \{u2013\} developed by the floods group of the Natural Hazards Project of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) \{u2013\} was employed. Validation of hindcasts was made over the RIEN point of river Rhine (NL) where coincident observations were available. Considering the physical driver complexity behind interactions among surge, wave height and discharge variables, hindcasts were found to perform quite well, not only simulating observation values over the common interval of interest, but also in resolving the right type and strength of both correlations and statistical dependencies. Results are presented by means of analytical tables and detailed maps referring to both correlation and dependence (?) values being estimated over RIEN points. In particular, dependencies coming from such analytical tables can be used in an easy way to calculate the joint return period for any combined event by inserting ? in a simple formula containing the individual return periods of source variables. It is then straightforward to estimate the joint probability value as the inverse of the joint return period. Overall, the highest values of (strong / very strong) correlations and dependencies were found between surges and waves mainly over North Sea and English Channel with (such combined) events to take place on the same day (zero-lag mode). Moderate to well category dependencies were found for most sea areas, also on a zero-lag mode. In the case of surge and river discharge, moderate to well category values were found in most cases but not in a zero-lag mode as in surge \& wave case. It became clear that in order to achieve such (relatively high) values, a considerable lag time interval of a few days was required with surge clearly leading discharge values. For the case of wave and river discharge, well to strong category values were found but once more mostly in non-zero lag mode indicating the necessity of a considerable lag time interval for dependence to reach such (well / strong) values with wave distinctly leading discharge values.},

  abstract = {Predictions of coastal evolution driven by episodic and persistent processes associated with storms and relative sea-level rise (SLR) are required to test our understanding, evaluate our predictive capability, and to provide guidance for coastal management decisions. Previous work demonstrated that the spatial variability of long-term shoreline change can be predicted using observed SLR rates, tide range, wave height, coastal slope, and a characterization of the geomorphic setting. The shoreline is not sufficient to indicate which processes are important in causing shoreline change, such as overwash that depends on coastal dune elevations. Predicting dune height is intrinsically important to assess future storm vulnerability. Here, we enhance shoreline-change predictions by including dune height as a variable in a statistical modeling approach. Dune height can also be used as an input variable, but it does not improve the shoreline-change prediction skill. Dune-height input does help to reduce prediction uncertainty. That is, by including dune height, the prediction is more precise but not more accurate. Comparing hindcast evaluations, better predictive skill was found when predicting dune height (0.8) compared with shoreline change (0.6). The skill depends on the level of detail of the model and we identify an optimized model that has high skill and minimal overfitting. The predictive model can be implemented with a range of forecast scenarios, and we illustrate the impacts of a higher future sea-level. This scenario shows that the shoreline change becomes increasingly erosional and more uncertain. Predicted dune heights are lower and the dune height uncertainty decreases.},

Erosion and flooding risks are often analysed separately owing to complex relationships between driving processes, morphological response and risk receptors. We argue that these risks should be considered jointly and illustrate this through discussion of three ‘expressions’ of this interactive relationship: coastal morphology modifies flood hazard; future flood risk depends on changing shoreline position; and the simultaneous occurrence of erosion–flooding events. Some critical thoughts are offered on the general applicability of these expressions and the implications for coastal risk management policy.},

In all countries, this became problematic when the coast underwent anthropogenic impact and acquired relevant economic value for uses, such as, transport, military, tourism or conservation. However, common ground technology developed according to each country’s political traditions, technical restrictions and economic viability. This paper outlines the major management aspects of coastal erosion and defence in Europe and discusses the large spectrum of shore protection strategies used. It depicts the current coastal defence scene for 25 European countries, and points to the major trends and challenges faced by coastal managers, land owners and users of European coasts, as coastal management embraces both engineering as well as socio-economic aspects.},

Rapid advances in computing, communications, and observational technologies - along with concomitant advances in high-resolution modeling, ensemble and coupled-systems predictions of the Earth system - are revolutionizing nearly every aspect of the geosciences. Modern data volumes from high-resolution ensemble prediction systems and next-generation remote-sensing systems like hyper-spectral satellite sensors and phased-array radars are staggering. The advent and maturity of cloud computing technologies and tools have opened new avenues for addressing both big data and Open Science challenges to accelerate scientific discoveries. There is broad consensus that as data volumes grow rapidly, it is particularly important to reduce data movement and bring processing and computations to the data. Data providers also need to give scientists an ecosystem that includes data, tools, workflows and other end-to-end applications and services needed to perform analysis, integration, interpretation, and synthesis - all in the same environment or platform. Instead of moving data to processing systems near users, as is the tradition, one will need to bring processing, computing, analysis and visualization to data - so called data proximate workbench capabilities, also known as server-side processing.},

Therefore, we cannot continue to depend on the highly uncertain coastal recession estimates obtained via the simple, deterministic method (Bruun rule) that has been widely used over the last 50~years. Furthermore, the emergence of risk management style coastal planning frameworks is now requiring probabilistic (rather than deterministic, single value) estimates of coastal recession. This paper describes the development and application of a process based model (PCR model) which provides probabilistic estimates of SLR driven coastal recession. The PCR model is proposed as a more appropriate and defensible method for determining coastal recession due to SLR for planning purposes in the twenty-first century and beyond.},

  abstract = {Precipitation nowcasting, the high-resolution forecasting of precipitation up to two hours ahead, supports the real-world socioeconomic needs of many sectors reliant on weather-dependent decision-making1,2. State-of-the-art operational nowcasting methods typically advect precipitation fields with radar-based wind estimates, and struggle to capture important non-linear events such as convective initiations3,4. Recently introduced deep learning methods use radar to directly predict future rain rates, free of physical constraints5,6. While they accurately predict low-intensity rainfall, their operational utility is limited because their lack of constraints produces blurry nowcasts at longer lead times, yielding poor performance on rarer medium-to-heavy rain events. Here we present a deep generative model for the probabilistic nowcasting of precipitation from radar that addresses these challenges. Using statistical, economic and cognitive measures, we show that our method provides improved forecast quality, forecast consistency and forecast value. Our model produces realistic and spatiotemporally consistent predictions over regions up to 1,536 km × 1,280 km and with lead times from 5–90 min ahead. Using a systematic evaluation by more than 50 expert meteorologists, we show that our generative model ranked first for its accuracy and usefulness in 89\% of cases against two competitive methods. When verified quantitatively, these nowcasts are skillful without resorting to blurring. We show that generative nowcasting can provide probabilistic predictions that improve forecast value and support operational utility, and at resolutions and lead times where alternative methods struggle.},

Here we show that the global wave power, which is the transport of the energy transferred from the wind into sea-surface motion, has increased globally (0.4\% per year) and by ocean basins since 1948. We also find long-term correlations and statistical dependency with sea surface temperatures, globally and by ocean sub-basins, particularly between the tropical Atlantic temperatures and the wave power in high south latitudes, the most energetic region globally. Results indicate the upper-ocean warming, a consequence of anthropogenic global warming, is changing the global wave climate, making waves stronger. This identifies wave power as a potentially valuable climate change indicator.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available.},

Pine Island Glacier retreated 31 km at its center, with most retreat in 2005–2009 when the glacier ungrounded from its ice plain. Thwaites Glacier retreated 14 km along its fast flow core and 1 to 9 km along the sides. Haynes Glacier retreated 10 km along its flanks. Smith/Kohler glaciers retreated the most, 35 km along its ice plain, and its ice shelf pinning points are vanishing. These rapid retreats proceed along regions of retrograde bed elevation mapped at a high spatial resolution using a mass conservation technique that removes residual ambiguities from prior mappings. Upstream of the 2011 grounding line positions, we find no major bed obstacle that would prevent the glaciers from further retreat and draw down the entire basin.},

We apply the one-line shoreline change model LX-Shore, which couples longshore and cross-shore processes and can handle complex shoreline planforms, non-erodible emerged headlands and submerged rocky features. The model skilfully reproduces the three dominant modes of shoreline variability, which are by decreasing order of variance: cross-shore migration, rotation, and a third mode possibly related to breathing. Model results confirm previous observations that longshore processes primarily contribute to the rotation and third modes on the timescales of months to seasons, while cross-shore processes control the shoreline migration on shorter timescales from hours (storms) to months. Additional simulations carried out in simplifying progressively the bathymetry show how the inherent geology strongly modulates the spatial modes of shoreline variability. The offshore central rocky outcrop is found to limit the rotation. In contrast, the submerged rocky platforms that extend from the headlands enhance the shoreline rotation mode and increase alongshore variability of the cross-shore migration mode, owing to increased alongshore variability in wave exposure. Offshore wave transformation across large-scale submerged rocky features and headland shape are therefore critical to contemporary shoreline dynamics.},

Shoreline change is primarily driven by the gradients in total longshore sediment transport and by the cross-shore transport owing to variability in incident wave energy. Application to academic cases and a real coast highlights the potential of LX-Shore to simulate shoreline change on timescales from hours (storm) to decades with low computational cost.

  abstract = {With large-scale human interventions and climate change unfolding as they are now, coastal changes at decadal timescales are not limited to incremental modifications of systems that are fixed in their general geometry, but often show significant changes in layout that may be catastrophic for populations living in previously safe areas. This poses severe challenges that are difficult to meet for existing models. A new free-form coastline model, ShorelineS, is presented that is able to describe large coastal transformations based on relatively simple principles of alongshore transport gradient driven changes as a result of coastline curvature, including under highly obliquely incident waves, and consideration of splitting and merging of coastlines, and longshore transport disturbance by hard structures. An arbitrary number of coast sections is supported, which can be open or closed and can interact with each other through relatively straightforward merging and splitting mechanisms. Rocky parts or structures may block wave energy and/or longshore sediment transport. These features allow for a rich behavior including shoreline undulations and formation of spits, migrating islands, merging of coastal shapes, salients and tombolos. The main formulations of the (open-source) model, which is freely available at www.shorelines.nl, are presented. Test cases show the capabilities of the flexible, vector-based model approach, while field validation cases for a large-scale sand nourishment (the Sand Engine; 21 million m3) and an accreting groin scheme at Al-Gamil (Egypt) show the model’s capability of computing realistic rates of coastline change as well as a good representation of the shoreline shape for real situations.},

  abstract = {The application of an integrated data analysis and modeling scheme reveals that decadal-scale shoreline evolution along a U.S. Pacific Northwest littoral cell is highly dependent on both sediment supply and wave climate variability. In particular, accurate estimates of (Columbia River) sediment supply and sediment feeding from the lower shoreface are critical components of balancing the barrier beach sediment budget and are therefore essential to making sensible shoreline change hindcasts and forecasts. A simple deterministic one-line shoreline change model, applied in a quasi-probabilistic manner, enables evaluation of the influence of sediment supply and wave climate variability through simulation of historical shoreline change. Through iteration, a range of realistic scenarios are developed to constrain decadal-scale shoreline change predictions. Modeled shoreline changes are significantly sensitive to directional changes in the incident waves, and therefore sensitive to the occurrence of interannual climatic fluctuations such as major El Niño events. A predicted increase in the intensity of the east Pacific wave climate (1.0m increase in significant wave height in 20yr) affects forecast shoreline positions only when this increase occurs during the winter storm season. However, the effect of this increase in storm power during any given year is small relative to the impact of major El Niño events. The model has significant skill in decadal-scale hindcasts suggesting that alongshore gradients in sediment transport dominate coastal change at this scale at this site. However, both data and model results suggest that net onshore feeding from the lower shoreface is responsible for approximately 20\% of the decadal-scale coastal change. Field measurements and poor model skill at annual scale indicate that cross-shore processes likely dominate coastal change at shorter time scales.},

  abstract = {The physical environment of the intertidal zone presents a number of challenges which make traditional surveying methods difficult to implement; whilst the acquisition cost of airborne elevation data can be prohibitive beyond localised applications. Remote sensing data from earth observation satellites has been well established as a method for mapping the extent and elevation profile of the intertidal zone; however the majority of these applications are local in nature, and based on analysis of a limited number of individual image observations. In this paper we outline an automated methodology to model the intertidal extent and topography of the Australian coastline, that leverages a full time series of Landsat observations from 1987 to 2015 managed in the Australian Geoscience Data Cube (AGDC). Our approach reframes the analysis from time of acquisition into the tidal domain through the use of a continental scale tidal model, combined with a median pixel compositing of Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) stacks, to robustly estimate the tidal extent and elevation profile across the observed tidal range. We demonstrate the ability of a median-based compositing approach to deal effectively with data quality, modelling outliers and other issues that commonly affect single scene methodologies. Our new framework enables us to produce a continental-scale intertidal model, detailing intertidal zone topography at a 25m spatial scale. We then demonstrate the potential of the modelling framework to derive digital elevation data based on tidal model attribution, validating our models against in-situ GPS observations, before discussing issues that must be addressed to move this capability to a continental scale. The ability of the model to examine coastal stability is introduced, in the context of the conceptual reframing of the data into the tidal domain, with a view to furthering this application in future versions of the model.},

  abstract = {Generating continental-scale pixel composites in dynamic coastal and estuarine environments presents a unique challenge, as the application of a temporal or seasonal approach to composite generation is confounded by tidal influences. We demonstrate how this can be resolved using an approach to compositing that provides robust composites of multi-type environments. In addition to the visual aesthetics of the images created, we demonstrate the utility of these composites for further interpretation and analysis. This is enabled by the manner in which our approach captures the spatial variation in tidal dynamics through the use of a Voronoi mesh, and preserves the band relationships within the modelled spectra at each pixel. Case studies are presented which include continental-scale mosaics of the Australian coastline at high and low tide, and tailored examples demonstrating the potential of the tidally constrained composites to address a range of coastal change detection and monitoring applications. We conclude with a discussion on the potential applications of the composite products and method in the coastal and marine environment, as well as further development directions for our tidal modelling framework.},

Attempting to model the response of a landscape as geomorphologically volatile as beaches requires multiple precise measurements to recognize responses to the actions of various geomorphic agents. It is therefore essential to have monitoring systems capable of systematically recording the shoreline accurately and effectively. New methods and tools are required to efficiently capture, characterize, and analyze information – and so obtain geomorphologically significant indicators. This is the aim of the doctoral thesis, focusing on the development of tools and procedures for coastal monitoring using satellite images and terrestrial photographs. The work brings satellite image processing and photogrammetric solutions to scientists, engineers, and coastal managers by providing results that demonstrate the usefulness of these viable and lowcost techniques. Existing and freely accessible public information (satellite images, video-derived data, or crowdsourced photographs) can be converted into high quality data for monitoring morphological changes on beaches and thus help achieve a sustainable management of coastal resources.},

Such actions are well supported by existing governance structures and investment ve­ hicles. For others however, continuing to provide protection from flooding may not be technically feasible or financially viable. For these communities, transformational adaptation will be needed (including realignment or relocation). Implementing transformational change, however, is difficult and requires a clarity of long-term planning and a means of supporting communities to take early action in making this transition.},

The semi-automated classification of the imagery was accomplished by manual selection of training points representing water and non-water classes along the entire global coastline. Polygon topology was applied to the GSV, resulting in a new characterisation of the number and size of global islands. Three size classes of islands were mapped: continental mainlands (5), islands greater than 1 km2 (21,818), and islands smaller than 1 km2 (318,868). The GSV represents the shore zone land and water interface boundary, and is a spatially explicit ecological domain separator between terrestrial and marine environments. The development and characteristics of the GSV are presented herein. An approach is also proposed for delineating standardised, high spatial resolution global ecological coastal units (ECUs). For this coastal ecosystem mapping effort, the GSV will be used to separate the nearshore coastal waters from the onshore coastal lands. The work to produce the GSV and the ECUs is commissioned by the Group on Earth Observations (GEO), and is associated with several GEO initiatives including GEO Ecosystems, GEO Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) and GEO Blue Planet.},

  abstract = {Detection of a periodic signal hidden in noise is frequently a goal in astronomical data analysis. This paper does not introduce a new detection technique, but instead studies the reliability and efficiency of detection with the most commonly used technique, the periodogram, in the case where the observation times are unevenly spaced. This choice was made because, of the methods in current use, it appears to have the simplest statistical behavior. A modification of the classical definition of the periodogram is necessary in order to retain the simple statistical behavior of the evenly spaced case. With this modification, periodogram analysis and least-squares fitting of sine waves to the data are exactly equivalent. Certain difficulties with the use of the periodogram are less important than commonly beheved in the case of detection of strictly periodic signals. In addition, the standard method for mitigating these difficulties (tapering) can be used just as well if the sampling is uneven. An analysis of the statistical significance of signal detections is presented, with examples.},

  abstract = {The response of coastal wetlands to sea-level rise during the twenty-first century remains uncertain. Global-scale projections suggest that between 20 and 90 per cent (for low and high sea-level rise scenarios, respectively) of the present-day coastal wetland area will be lost, which will in turn result in the loss of biodiversity and highly valued ecosystem services1–3. These projections do not necessarily take into account all essential geomorphological4–7 and socio-economic system feedbacks8. Here we present an integrated global modelling approach that considers both the ability of coastal wetlands to build up vertically by sediment accretion, and the accommodation space, namely, the vertical and lateral space available for fine sediments to accumulate and be colonized by wetland vegetation. We use this approach to assess global-scale changes in coastal wetland area in response to global sea-level rise and anthropogenic coastal occupation during the twenty-first century. On the basis of our simulations, we find that, globally, rather than losses, wetland gains of up to 60 per cent of the current area are possible, if more than 37 per cent (our upper estimate for current accommodation space) of coastal wetlands have sufficient accommodation space, and sediment supply remains at present levels. In contrast to previous studies1–3, we project that until 2100, the loss of global coastal wetland area will range between 0 and 30 per cent, assuming no further accommodation space in addition to current levels. Our simulations suggest that the resilience of global wetlands is primarily driven by the availability of accommodation space, which is strongly influenced by the building of anthropogenic infrastructure in the coastal zone and such infrastructure is expected to change over the twenty-first century. Rather than being an inevitable consequence of global sea-level rise, our findings indicate that large-scale loss of coastal wetlands might be avoidable, if sufficient additional accommodation space can be created through careful nature-based adaptation solutions to coastal management.},

Storm clusters can be defined in many different ways but the term generally refers to a sequence of coastal storm events separated by a short time interval. Assessing storm clustering impacts on coasts implies that people are able to study the impact of each storm event within the cluster and not just consider the cluster as a ‘single’ large event. In most cases, the cluster designates a rapid succession of energetic events that make the usual approaches used to assessing ‘single’ storms inappropriate. The chapter provides a short summary of the approaches and methodologies used to address storm clustering. Field data collections are an important source of information to assess storm clustering and coastal impact. Finally, the chapter presents a summary on the key processes that should be included to more specifically address storm clustering impact on shoreline and beach morphology.},

However, many coastal hazard mitigation plans do not consider sea level rise when assessing storm surge risk. Here we apply a GIS-based approach to quantify potential changes in storm surge risk due to sea level rise on Long Island, New York. We demonstrate a method for combining hazard exposure and community vulnerability to spatially characterize risk for both present and future sea level conditions using commonly available national data sets. Our results show that sea level rise will likely increase risk in many coastal areas and will potentially create risk where it was not before. We find that even modest and probable sea level rise (.5~m by 2080) vastly increases the numbers of people (47\% increase) and property loss (73\% increase) impacted by storm surge. In addition, the resulting maps of hazard exposure and community vulnerability provide a clear and useful example of the visual representation of the spatial distribution of the components of risk that can be helpful for developing targeted hazard mitigation and climate change adaptation strategies. Our results suggest that coastal agencies tasked with managing storm surge risk must consider the effects of sea level rise if they are to ensure safe and sustainable coastal communities in the future.},

  abstract = {This Technical Summary to the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) comprises a compilation of the chapter executive summaries illustrated with figures from the report. It follows the structure of the SRCCL (Figure TS.1) and is presented in seven parts. TS.1 (Chapter 1) provides a synopsis of the main issues addressed in the Special Report, introducing key concepts and definitions and highlighting where the report builds on previous publications. TS.2 (Chapter 2) focuses on the dynamics of the land–climate system (Figure TS.2). It assesses recent progress towards understanding the impacts of climate change on land, and the feedbacks land has on climate and which arise from altered biogeochemical and biophysical fluxes between the atmosphere and the land surface. TS.3 (Chapter 3) examines how the world’s dryland populations are uniquely vulnerable to desertification and climate change, but also have significant knowledge in adapting to climate variability and addressing desertification. TS.4 (Chapter 4) assesses the urgency of tackling land degradation across all land ecosystems. Despite accelerating trends of land degradation, reversing these trends is attainable through restoration efforts and improved land management, which is expected to improve resilience to climate change, mitigate climate change, and ensure food security for generations to come. TS.5 (Chapter 5) focuses on food security, with an assessment of the risks and opportunities that climate change presents to food systems. It considers how mitigation and adaptation can contribute to both human and planetary health. TS.6 (Chapter 6) introduces options for responding to the challenges of desertification, land degradation and food security and evaluates the trade-offs for sustainable land management, climate adaptation and mitigation, and the sustainable development goals. TS.7 (Chapter 7) further assesses decision making and policy responses to risks in the climate-land-human system.},

  abstract = {Researchers and coastal managers are pondering how accelerated sea-level rise and possibly intensified storms will affect shorelines. These issues are most often investigated in a cross-shore profile framework, fostering the implicit assumption that coastline responses will be approximately uniform in the alongshore direction. However, experiments with a recently developed numerical model of coastline change on a large spatial domain suggest that the shoreline responses to climate change could be highly variable. As storm and wave climates change, large-scale coastline shapes are likely to shift—causing areas of greatly accelerated coastal erosion to alternate with areas of considerable shoreline accretion. On complex-shaped coastlines, including cuspate-cape and spit coastlines, the alongshore variation in shoreline retreat rates could be an order of magnitude higher than the baseline retreat rate expected from sea-level rise alone.},

  abstract = {When modeling the large-scale ({$>$} km) evolution of coastline morphology, the influence of natural forces is not the only consideration; ongoing direct human manipulations can substantially drive geomorphic change. In this paper, we couple a human component to a numerical model of large-scale coastline evolution, incorporating beach “nourishment” (periodically placing sand on the beach, also called “beach replenishment” or “beach fill”). Beach nourishment is the most prevalent means humans employ to alter the natural shoreline system in our case study, the Carolina coastline. Beach nourishment can cause shorelines adjacent to those that are nourished to shift both seaward and landward. When we further consider how changes to storm behaviors could change wave climates, the magnitude of morphological change induced by beach nourishment can rival that expected from sea level rise and affect the coast as far as tens of kilometers away from the nourishment site. In some instances, nonlocal processes governing large-scale cuspate-cape coastline evolution may transmit the human morphological “signal” over surprisingly large (hundreds of kilometer) distances.},

  abstract = {The Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment Wetland Change Model (DIVA\_WCM) comprises a dataset of contemporary global coastal wetland stocks (estimated at 756×103km2 (in 2011)), mapped to a one-dimensional global database, and a model of the macro-scale controls on wetland response to sea-level rise. Three key drivers of wetland response to sea-level rise are considered: 1) rate of sea-level rise relative to tidal range; 2) lateral accommodation space; and 3) sediment supply. The model is tuned by expert knowledge, parameterised with quantitative data where possible, and validated against mapping associated with two large-scale mangrove and saltmarsh vulnerability studies. It is applied across 12,148 coastal segments (mean length 85km) to the year 2100. The model provides better-informed macro-scale projections of likely patterns of future coastal wetland losses across a range of sea-level rise scenarios and varying assumptions about the construction of coastal dikes to prevent sea flooding (as dikes limit lateral accommodation space and cause coastal squeeze). With 50cm of sea-level rise by 2100, the model predicts a loss of 46–59\% of global coastal wetland stocks. A global coastal wetland loss of 78\% is estimated under high sea-level rise (110cm by 2100) accompanied by maximum dike construction. The primary driver for high vulnerability of coastal wetlands to sea-level rise is coastal squeeze, a consequence of long-term coastal protection strategies. Under low sea-level rise (29cm by 2100) losses do not exceed ca. 50\% of the total stock, even for the same adverse dike construction assumptions. The model results confirm that the widespread paradigm that wetlands subject to a micro-tidal regime are likely to be more vulnerable to loss than macro-tidal environments. Countering these potential losses will require both climate mitigation (a global response) to minimise sea-level rise and maximisation of accommodation space and sediment supply (a regional response) on low-lying coasts.},

  abstract = {Remotely sensed geospatial data are critical for applications including precision agriculture, urban planning, disaster monitoring and response, and climate change research, among others. Deep learning methods are particularly promising for modeling many remote sensing tasks given the success of deep neural networks in similar computer vision tasks and the sheer volume of remotely sensed imagery available. However, the variance in data collection methods and handling of geospatial metadata make the application of deep learning methodology to remotely sensed data nontrivial. For example, satellite imagery often includes additional spectral bands beyond red, green, and blue and must be joined to other geospatial data sources that can have differing coordinate systems, bounds, and resolutions. To help realize the potential of deep learning for remote sensing applications, we introduce TorchGeo, a Python library for integrating geospatial data into the PyTorch deep learning ecosystem. TorchGeo provides data loaders for a variety of benchmark datasets, composable datasets for generic geospatial data sources, samplers for geospatial data, and transforms that work with multispectral imagery. TorchGeo is also the first library to provide pre-trained models for multispectral satellite imagery (e.g., models that use all bands from the Sentinel-2 satellites), allowing for advances in transfer learning on downstream remote sensing tasks with limited labeled data. We use TorchGeo to create reproducible benchmark results on existing datasets and benchmark our proposed method for preprocessing geospatial imagery on the fly. TorchGeo is open source and available on GitHub: https://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo.},

Our capability to understand and especially predict this variability is still limited. This can lead to misinterpretation of coastal change information, which hampers informed decision making and the subsequent design and implementation of (soft) engineering interventions. Collecting and describing example observations of shore and shoreline variability is one way to support and improve such human intervention. This paper describes causes and factors for the variability and the resulting possible evolutions of wave-dominated shores and shorelines, which are illustrated by a number of case studies. The new element of this work is that the variability is described in terms of a range of different time and space scales, which helps to structure such analysis. However, it is difficult to generalise the results for arbitrary situations, especially on decadal time scales. Scientific and engineering improvements require more quantitative insight into the physical mechanisms behind the free and forced shore behaviour responsible for the variability.},

The model is verified for the evolution of an initially straight shoreline of a plane beach subject to regular breaking waves at constant angle of incidence in the presence of either a groyne or a continuous single-point feed of sediment. Grid convergence and stability tests are used to obtain accurate, stable results, with satisfactory computational efficiency. Influences of wave input filtering and event-based sediment loading are considered. The rapid deterministic model is applied to Monte-Carlo simulations of the evolution of the west coast of Calabria, Italy for different scenarios including increased sediment load from a river and selected beach nourishment. The potential role of probabilistic shoreline evolution in regional coastal flood-risk assessment is explored through application to an idealised stretch of the Holderness coastline, U.K., where flood depths and expected damage are estimated for a 1000 year return period event.},

  abstract = {Estimates of future beach evolution in response to sea-level rise are needed to assess coastal vulnerability. A research gap is identified in providing adequate predictive methods to use for platform beaches. This work describes a simple model to evaluate the effects of sea-level rise on platform beaches that relies on the conservation of beach sand volume and assumes an invariant beach profile shape. In closed systems, when compared with the Inundation Model, results show larger retreats; the differences are higher for beaches with wide berms and when the shore platform develops at shallow depths. The application of the proposed model to Cascais (Portugal) beaches, using 21st century sea-level rise scenarios, shows that there will be a significant reduction in beach width.},

  abstract = {Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud-based geospatial processing platform for large-scale environmental monitoring and analysis. The free-to-use GEE platform provides access to (1) petabytes of publicly available remote sensing imagery and other ready-to-use products with an explorer web app; (2) high-speed parallel processing and machine learning algorithms using Google’s computational infrastructure; and (3) a library of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) with development environments that support popular coding languages, such as JavaScript and Python. Together these core features enable users to discover, analyze and visualize geospatial big data in powerful ways without needing access to supercomputers or specialized coding expertise. The development of GEE has created much enthusiasm and engagement in the remote sensing and geospatial data science fields. Yet after a decade since GEE was launched, its impact on remote sensing and geospatial science has not been carefully explored. Thus, a systematic review of GEE that can provide readers with the “big picture” of the current status and general trends in GEE is needed. To this end, the decision was taken to perform a meta-analysis investigation of recent peer-reviewed GEE articles focusing on several features, including data, sensor type, study area, spatial resolution, application, strategy, and analytical methods. A total of 349 peer-reviewed articles published in 146 different journals between 2010 and October 2019 were reviewed. Publications and geographical distribution trends showed a broad spectrum of applications in environmental analyses at both regional and global scales. Remote sensing datasets were used in 90\% of studies while 10\% of the articles utilized ready-to-use products for analyses. Optical satellite imagery with medium spatial resolution, particularly Landsat data with an archive exceeding 40 years, has been used extensively. Linear regression and random forest were the most frequently used algorithms for satellite imagery processing. Among ready-to-use products, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used in 27\% of studies for vegetation, crop, land cover mapping and drought monitoring. The results of this study confirm that GEE has and continues to make substantive progress on global challenges involving process of geo-big data.},

Due to the high complexity of coastal environments, where different natural and anthropogenic phenomenon interact, the selection of the most appropriate sensor(s) is related to the applications required, and the different types of resolutions available (spatial, spectral, radiometric, and temporal) need to be considered. The development of specific techniques and tools based on the processing of optical satellite images makes possible the production of information useful for coastal environment management, without any destructive impacts. This chapter will highlight different subjects related to coastal environments: shoreline change detection, ocean color, water quality, river plumes, coral reef, alga bloom, bathymetry, wetland mapping, and coastal hazards/vulnerability. The main objective of this chapter is not an exhaustive description of the image processing methods/algorithms employed in coastal environmental studies, but focus in the range of applications available. Several limitations were identified. The major challenge still is to have remote-sensing techniques adopted as a routine tool in assessment of change in the coastal zone. Continuing research is required into the techniques employed for assessing change in the coastal environment.},

Projections of shoreline retreat are highly uncertain, however, namely due to deeply uncertain mean sea level projections and the absence of consensus on a coastal impact model. An improved understanding and a better quantification of these sources of deep uncertainty are hence required to improve coastal risk management and inform adaptation decisions. In this work we present and apply a new extra-probabilistic framework to develop shoreline change projections of sandy coasts that allows consideration of intrinsic (or aleatory) and knowledge-based (or epistemic) uncertainties exhaustively and transparently. This framework builds upon an empirical shoreline change model to which we ascribe possibility functions to represent deeply uncertain variables. The model is applied to two local sites in Aquitaine (France) and Castellón (Spain). First, we validate the framework against historical shoreline observations and then develop shoreline change projections that account for possible (although unlikely) low-end and high-end mean sea level scenarios. Our high-end projections show for instance that shoreline retreats of up to 200 m in Aquitaine and 130 m in Castellón are plausible by 2100, while low-end projections revealed that 58 and 37 m modest shoreline retreats, respectively, are also plausible. Such extended intervals of possible future shoreline changes reflect an ambiguity in the probabilistic description of shoreline change projections, which could be substantially reduced by better constraining sea level rise (SLR) projections and improving coastal impact models. We found for instance that if mean sea level by 2100 does not exceed 1 m, the ambiguity can be reduced by more than 50 \%. This could be achieved through an ambitious climate mitigation policy and improved knowledge on ice sheets.\textbackslash textless/p\textbackslash textgreater},

While there is considerable relevant research, in the authors’ experience this problem remains challenging for coastal engineering. This paper reviews important challenges in this respect and identifies three key actions to address them: (a) refocusing traditional practice towards more climate-aware approaches; (b) developing more comprehensive risk frameworks that include the multi-dimensionality and non-stationarity of their components and consideration of uncertainty; and (c) building bridges between risk assessment and adaptation theory and practice. We conclude that the way forward includes numerous activities including increased observations; the attribution of coastal impacts to their drivers; enhanced climate projections and their integration into impact models; more impact assessments at the local scale; dynamic projections of spatially-distributed exposure and vulnerability; and exploring inherently adaptive options. Given the complexity of the possible solutions, more practical guidance is required.},

These processes result primarily from the combination of mean sea level, waves, storm surges and tides, which are affected by global and regional climate change, and whose uncertainty increases with time. This paper reviews the current state of the art of methods used to model climate change-induced coastal erosion focusing on how climate change-related drivers and the associated uncertainty are considered. We identify research gaps, describe and analyse the key components of a comprehensive framework to derive future estimates of shoreline change and make suggestions for good practice. Within the scope of the review, we find that although significant progress has been made over the last decade, most of the studies limit uncertainty sampling to considering ranges of variation of forcing variables and ensembles of emissions scenarios, and applications with high level of probabilistic development remain few. Further research is necessary to fully (a) incorporate projected time series of coastal drivers into the erosion models, including bias correction; (b) sufficiently sample the uncertainty associated with each step of the top-down approach, including the consideration of different emission scenarios, inter- and intra-model variability, and multiple runs of erosion models or model ensembles; and (c) reduce uncertainty in shoreline change estimates by developing better datasets and model parameterisations, and progressing in detection and attribution.},

The use of climate data with high space-time resolution enabled the reconstruction of the shoreline response to cross-shore forcing both historically and throughout the twenty-first century. Cross section–based equilibrium models were combined to assess beach erosion induced by local waves, storm surge, astronomical tide and mean sea-level rise. The approach incorporates the potential impacts that tidal inlets could have on the long-term evolution of adjacent beaches as sink terms in the beaches’ budget. The methodology provides probabilistic estimates of coastline recession while accounting for sea level rise uncertainty, both of which are essential aspects for establishing adaptation priorities and efficient fund allocation. The outlined assessment was undertaken on 57 sandy beaches along a 345 km coastline stretch in Asturias, a region in the northwest of Spain open to the Atlantic.},

  abstract = {With coastal erosion and the increased interest in beach monitoring, there is a greater need for evaluation of the shoreline detection methods. Some studies have been conducted to produce state of the art reviews on shoreline definition and detection. It should be noted that with the development of remote sensing, shoreline detection is mainly achieved by image processing. Thus, it is important to evaluate the different image processing approaches used for shoreline detection. This paper presents a state of the art review on image processing methods used for shoreline detection in remote sensing. It starts with a review of different key concepts that can be used for shoreline detection. Then, the applied fundamental image processing methods are shown before a comparative analysis of these methods. A significant outcome of this study will provide practical insights into shoreline detection.},

Benefits include increasing the efficiency of hydrographic surveying, providing a stable consistent reference frame and enabling integration with land data in the coastal zone. Seven contemporary global ocean tide models are used to derive Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT) surfaces which are each assessed by comparison with LAT values from the 7,389-strong UKHO tide gauge database, with the results correlated with distance from land. The proportion of truly offshore and pelagic gauges is relatively limited; however, the transition zone whereby the global ocean tide models commence to deteriorate in accuracy is evident at approximately 30km from the coast. The DTU10 model was selected as the strongest candidate overall. Subsequently, a thin plate spline method is used with the tide gauge dataset to enhance the DTU10 LAT surface in the coastal zone, creating a high resolution global LAT surface with respect to mean sea level. It is seen by cross-validation that the method may be used to predict LAT in near-shore locations with a standard error of 0.23 m.},

  abstract = {This Short Communication provides a Coastal Engineering perspective on present and emerging capabilities of satellite optical imagery, including real-world applications that can now be realistically implemented from the desktop. Significantly, at the vast majority of locations worldwide, satellite remote sensing is currently the only source of information to complement much more limited in-situ instrumentation for land and sea mapping, monitoring and measurement. Less well recognised is that publicly available, routinely sampled and now easily accessible optical imagery covering virtually every position along the world's coastlines already spans multiple decades. In the past five years the common obstacles of (1) limited access to high-performance computing and (2) specialist remote sensing technical expertise, have been largely removed. The emergence of several internet-accessible application programming interfaces (APIs) now enable applied users to access petabytes of satellite imagery along with the necessary tools and processing power to extract, manipulate and analyse information of practical interest. Following a brief overview and timeline of civilian Earth observations from space, satellite-derived shorelines (SDS) and satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) are used to introduce and demonstrate some of the present real-world capabilities of satellite optical imagery most relevant to coastal professionals and researchers. These practical examples illustrate the use of satellite imagery to monitor and quantify both engineered and storm-induced coastline changes, as well as the emerging potential to obtain seamless topo/bathy surveys along coastal regions. Significantly, timescales of satellite-derived changes at the coast can range from decades to days, with spatial scales of interest extending from individual project sites up to unprecedented regional and global studies. While we foresee the uptake and routine use of satellite-derived information becoming quickly ubiquitous within the Coastal Engineering profession, on-ground observations are – and in our view will remain - fundamentally important. Compared to precision in-situ instrumentation, present intrinsic limitations of satellites are their relatively low rates of revisit and decimetre spatial accuracy. New satellite advances including ‘video from space’ and the potential to combine Earth observation with numerical and data-driven coastal models through assimilation and artificial intelligence are advances that we foresee will have future major impact in Coastal Engineering.},

  abstract = {A global coastal database has been developed within the context of the DINAS-COAST project (Dynamic and Interactive Assessment of National, regional and Global Vulnerability of Coastal Zones to Climate Change and Sea-Level Rise). The database, which has been specifically designed to address the needs of researchers in the area of vulnerability assessment of coastal zones, integrates information on physical, ecological and socio-economic characteristics of the coast at various resolutions and covers the world’s coastline, excluding Antarctica. Initially developed within a Geographic Information System, this global database forms an integral part of the DINAS-COAST system and one of the principal components of DIVA, the modelling and assessment tool that the project has produced. In order to comply with the physical and functional requirements of this tool, the database design has been based on a linear data model for the representation of the world’s coast. According to this model, all the data in DIVA are expressed to linear coastal segments of variable length, thus giving the DIVA database a fundamentally different data structure to the more common raster datasets used in global studies. The decomposition of the world’s coastline into segments has been based on a series of physical, administrative and socio-economic criteria and has resulted in 12,148 segments which represent homogeneous units in terms of impacts and vulnerability to sea-level rise and constitute the reference units on which all subsequent modelling and analysis are based. The selection of the data model and the representation of coastal space within DIVA have constituted two of the main challenges of the database design and have formed the basis for the compilation of a reliable, coherent and easy-to-use database that allows for consistent evaluations of coastal-zone vulnerability to sea-level rise at regional and global scales. It is expected that the DINAS-COAST database will provide researchers and modellers from various disciplines with an efficient and consistent basis for studying coastal systems, assessing coastal vulnerability and formulating broad policy responses to climate change.},

  abstract = {Sea level is rising due to climate change and is expected to influence the development and dynamics of coastal dunes. However, the anticipated changes to coastal dunes have not yet been demonstrated using field data. Here, we provide evidence of dune translation that is characterized by a linear increase of the dune toe elevation on the order of 13–15 mm/year during recent decades along the Dutch coast. This rate of increase is a remarkable 7–8 times greater than the measured sea level rise. The observed vertical dune toe translation coincides with seaward movement of the dune toe (i.e., progradation), which shows similarities to prograding coasts in the Holocene both along the Dutch coast and elsewhere. Thus, we suspect that other locations besides the Dutch coast might also show such large ratios between sea level rise and dune toe elevation increase. This phenomenon might significantly influence the expected impact of sea level rise and climate change adaptation measures.},

There appears to be some confusion among researchers, however, about best practices for cross-validation, and about the interpretation of cross-validation results. In particular, repeated cross-validation is often advocated, and so is the reporting of standard deviations, confidence intervals, or an indication of ”significance”. In this paper, we argue that, under many practical circumstances, when the goal of the experiments is to see how well the model returned by a learner will perform in practice in a particular domain, repeated cross-validation is not useful, and the reporting of confidence intervals or significance is misleading. Our arguments are supported by experimental results.},

  abstract = {Automatically detecting the wet/dry shoreline from remote sensing imagery has many benefits for beach management in coastal areas by enabling managers to take measures to protect wildlife during high water events. This paper proposes the use of a modified HED (Holistically-Nested Edge Detection) architecture to create a model for automatic feature identification of the wet/dry shoreline and to compute its elevation from the associated DSM (Digital Surface Model). The model is generalizable to several beaches in Texas and Florida. The data from the multiple beaches was collected using UAS (Uncrewed Aircraft Systems). UAS allow for the collection of high-resolution imagery and the creation of the DSMs that are essential for computing the elevations of the wet/dry shorelines. Another advantage of using UAS is the flexibility to choose locations and metocean conditions, allowing to collect a varied dataset necessary to calibrate a general model. To evaluate the performance and the generalization of the AI model, we trained the model on data from eight flights over four locations, tested it on the data from a ninth flight, and repeated it for all possible combinations. The AP and F1-Scores obtained show the success of the model’s prediction for the majority of cases, but the limitations of a pure computer vision assessment are discussed in the context of this coastal application. The method was also assessed more directly, where the average elevations of the labeled and AI predicted wet/dry shorelines were compared. The absolute differences between the two elevations were, on average, 2.1 cm, while the absolute difference of the elevations’ standard deviations for each wet/dry shoreline was 2.2 cm. The proposed method results in a generalizable model able to delineate the wet/dry shoreline in beach imagery for multiple flights at several locations in Texas and Florida and for a range of metocean conditions.},

The problem of getting an appropriate absolute gradient magnitude for edges lies in the method used. The Sobel operator performs a 2-D spatial gradient measurement on images. Transferring a 2-D pixel array into statistically uncorrelated data set enhances the removal of redundant data, as a result, reduction of the amount of data is required to represent a digital image. The Sobel edge detector uses a pair of 3 x 3 convolution masks, one estimating gradient in the x-direction and the other estimating gradient in y–direction. The Sobel detector is incredibly sensitive to noise in pictures, it effectively highlight them as edges. Hence, Sobel operator is recommended in massive data communication found in data transfer.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is driving sea level rise, leading to numerous impacts on the coastal zone, such as increased coastal flooding, beach erosion, cliff failure, saltwater intrusion in aquifers, and groundwater inundation. Many beaches around the world are currently experiencing chronic erosion as a result of gradual, present-day rates of sea level rise (about 3 mm/year) and human-driven restrictions in sand supply (e.g., harbor dredging and river damming). Accelerated sea level rise threatens to worsen coastal erosion and challenge the very existence of natural beaches throughout the world. Understanding and predicting the rates of sea level rise and coastal erosion depends on integrating data on natural systems with computer simulations. Although many computer modeling approaches are available to simulate shoreline change, few are capable of making reliable long-term predictions needed for full adaption or to enhance resilience. Recent advancements have allowed convincing decadal to centennial-scale predictions of shoreline evolution. For example, along 500 km of the Southern California coast, a new model featuring data assimilation predicts that up to 67\% of beaches may completely erode by 2100 without large-scale human interventions. In spite of recent advancements, coastal evolution models must continue to improve in their theoretical framework, quantification of accuracy and uncertainty, computational efficiency, predictive capability, and integration with observed data, in order to meet the scientific and engineering challenges produced by a changing climate.},

  abstract = {We present a shoreline change model for coastal hazard assessment and management planning. The model, CoSMoS-COAST (Coastal One-line Assimilated Simulation Tool), is a transect-based, one-line model that predicts short-term and long-term shoreline response to climate change in the 21st century. The proposed model represents a novel, modular synthesis of process-based models of coastline evolution due to longshore and cross-shore transport by waves and sea level rise. Additionally, the model uses an extended Kalman filter for data assimilation of historical shoreline positions to improve estimates of model parameters and thereby improve confidence in long-term predictions. We apply CoSMoS-COAST to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 km of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting. Aided by data assimilation, the model is able to reproduce the observed signal of seasonal shoreline change for the hindcast period of 1995–2010, showing excellent agreement between modeled and observed beach states. The skill of the model during the hindcast period improves confidence in the model's predictive capability when applied to the forecast period (2010–2100) driven by GCM-projected wave and sea level conditions. Predictions of shoreline change with limited human intervention indicate that 31\% to 67\% of Southern California beaches may become completely eroded by 2100 under sea level rise scenarios of 0.93 to 2.0 m.},

  abstract = {Internationally, national risk assessment (NRA) is rapidly gaining government sympathy as a science-based approach toward prioritizing the management of national hazards and threats, with the Netherlands and the United Kingdom in leading positions since 2007. NRAs are proliferating in Europe; they are also conducted in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States, while regional RAs now exist for over 100 Dutch or British provinces or counties. Focused on the Dutch NRA (DNRA) and supported by specific examples, summaries and evaluations are given of its (1) scenario development, (2) impact assessment, (3) likelihood estimation, (4) risk diagram, and (5) capability analysis. Despite the DNRA's thorough elaboration, apparent weaknesses are lack of stakeholder involvement, possibility of false-positive risk scenarios, rigid multicriteria impact evaluation, hybrid methods for likelihood estimation, half-hearted use of a “probability × effect” definition of risk, forced comparison of divergent risk scenarios, and unclear decision rules for risk acceptance and safety enhancement. Such weaknesses are not unique for the DNRA. In line with a somewhat reserved encouragement by the OECD (Studies in Risk Management. Innovation in Country Risk Management. Paris: OECD, 2009), the scientific solidity of NRA results so far is questioned, and several improvements are suggested. One critical point is that expert-driven NRAs may preempt political judgments and decisions by national security authorities. External review and validation of major NRA components is recommended for strengthening overall results as a reliable basis for national and/or regional safety policies. Meanwhile, a broader, more transactional concept of risk may lead to better national and regional risk assessments.},

  abstract = {Sandy beaches are unique environments composed of unconsolidated sediments that are constantly reshaped by the action of waves, tides, currents, and winds. The most seaward region of the dry beach, referred to as the beach face, is the primary interface between land and ocean and is of fundamental importance to coastal processes, including the dissipation and reflection of wave energy at the coast, and the exchange of sediment between the land and sea. The slope of the beach-face is 10 a critical parameter in coastal geomorphology and coastal engineering, necessary to calculate the total elevation and excursion of wave run-up at the shoreline. However, datasets of the beach-face slope remain unavailable along most of the world’s coastlines. This study presents a new dataset of beach-face slopes for the Australian coastline derived from a novel remote sensing technique. The dataset covers 13,200 km of sandy coast and provides an estimate of the beach-face slope at every 100 m alongshore, accompanied by an easy to apply measure of the confidence of each slope estimate. The dataset offers a unique 15 view of large-scale spatial variability in beach-face slope and addresses the growing need for this information to predict coastal hazards around Australia. The beach-face slope dataset and relevant metadata are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5606217 (Vos et al., 2021).},

  abstract = {The steepness of the beach face is a fundamental parameter for coastal morphodynamic research. Despite its importance, it remains extremely difficult to obtain reliable estimates of the beach-face slope over large spatial scales (thousands of km of coastline). In this letter, a novel approach to estimate this slope from time series of satellite-derived shoreline positions is presented. This new technique uses a frequency domain analysis to find the optimum slope that minimizes high-frequency tidal fluctuations relative to lower-frequency erosion/accretion signals. A detailed assessment of this new approach at eight locations spanning a range of tidal regimes, wave climates, and sediment grain sizes shows strong agreement (R2 = 0.93) with field measurements. The automated technique is then applied across thousands of beaches in eastern Australia and California, USA, revealing similar regional-scale distributions along these two contrasting coastlines and highlights the potential for new global-scale insight to beach-face slope spatial distribution, variability, and trends.},

  abstract = {Abstract In the Pacific Basin, El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant mode of interannual climate variability and drives substantial changes in oceanographic forcing, likely having a significant impact on Pacific coastlines. Yet, how sandy coasts respond to these basin-scale changes has to date been limited to a few long-term beach monitoring sites, predominantly on developed coasts. Here we use 35 years of Landsat imagery to map shoreline variability around the Pacific Rim (72,000 beach transects) and identify coherent patterns of beach erosion and accretion controlled by ENSO. We find that approximately one third of all beaches experience significant erosion during El Niño phases, with the Eastern Pacific particularly vulnerable to widespread erosion (most notably during the large 1997/1998 event). In contrast, La Niña events coincide with significant accretion for approximately one quarter of all beaches, although conversely drives substantial erosion in south-east Australia and other localized regions. The significant regional variability in coastal response to ENSO should be considered in light of future projected intensification and shifts in ENSO amplitudes and flavors.},

  abstract = {Coastal flooding related to marine extreme events has severe socioeconomic impacts, and even though the latter are projected to increase under the changing climate, there is a clear deficit of information and predictive capacity related to coastal flood mapping. The present contribution reports on efforts towards a new methodology for mapping coastal flood hazard at European scale, combining (i) the contribution of waves to the total water level; (ii) improved inundation modeling; and (iii) an open, physics-based framework which can be constantly upgraded, whenever new and more accurate data become available. Four inundation approaches of gradually increasing complexity and computational costs were evaluated in terms of their applicability to large-scale coastal flooding mapping: static inundation (SM); a semi-dynamic method, considering the water volume discharge over the dykes (VD); the flood intensity index approach (Iw); and the model LISFLOOD-FP (LFP). A validation test performed against observed flood extents during the Xynthia storm event showed that SM and VD can lead to an overestimation of flood extents by 232 and 209\%, while Iw and LFP showed satisfactory predictive skill. Application at pan-European scale for the present-day 100-year event confirmed that static approaches can overestimate flood extents by 56 \% compared to LFP; however, Iw can deliver results of reasonable accuracy in cases when reduced computational costs are a priority. Moreover, omitting the wave contribution in the extreme total water level (TWL) can result in a ĝ1/4 60 \% underestimation of the flooded area. The present findings have implications for impact assessment studies, since combination of the estimated inundation maps with population exposure maps revealed differences in the estimated number of people affected within the 20-70 \% range.},

Yet, comprehensive projections of ESL that include mean sea level (MSL), tides, waves, and storm surges do not exist. Here, we show changes in all components of ESLs until 2100 in view of climate change. We find that by the end of this century, the 100-year ESL along Europe's coastlines is on average projected to increase by 57 cm for Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP)4.5 and 81 cm for RCP8.5. The North Sea region is projected to face the highest increase in ESLs, amounting to nearly 1 m under RCP8.5 by 2100, followed by the Baltic Sea and Atlantic coasts of the UK and Ireland. Relative sea level rise (RSLR) is shown to be the main driver of the projected rise in ESL, with increasing dominance toward the end of the century and for the high-concentration pathway. Changes in storm surges and waves enhance the effects of RSLR along the majority of northern European coasts, locally with contributions up to 40\%. In southern Europe, episodic extreme events tend to stay stable, except along the Portuguese coast and the Gulf of Cadiz where reductions in surge and wave extremes offset RSLR by 20–30\%. By the end of this century, 5 million Europeans currently under threat of a 100-year ESL could be annually at risk from coastal flooding under high-end warming.

The North Sea region is projected to face the highest increase, amounting to nearly 1 m under a high emission scenario by 2100, followed by the Baltic Sea and Atlantic coasts of the UK and Ireland. Sea level rise is the main driver of the changes, but intensified climate extremes along most of northern Europe can have significant local effects. Little changes in climate extremes are shown along southern Europe, with the exception of a projected decrease along the Portuguese coast and the Gulf of Cadiz, offseting sea level rise by 20–30\%.

  abstract = {Global warming is expected to drive increasing extreme sea levels (ESLs) and flood risk along the world's coastlines. In this work we present probabilistic projections of ESLs for the present century taking into consideration changes in mean sea level, tides, wind-waves, and storm surges. Between the year 2000 and 2100 we project a very likely increase of the global average 100-year ESL of 34-76 cm under a moderate-emission-mitigation-policy scenario and of 58-172 cm under a business as usual scenario. Rising ESLs are mostly driven by thermal expansion, followed by contributions from ice mass-loss from glaciers, and ice-sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. Under these scenarios ESL rise would render a large part of the tropics exposed annually to the present-day 100-year event from 2050. By the end of this century this applies to most coastlines around the world, implying unprecedented flood risk levels unless timely adaptation measures are taken.},

  abstract = {Storm surges are an important coastal hazard component and it is unknown how they will evolve along Europe’s coastline in view of climate change. In the present contribution, the hydrodynamic model Delft3D-Flow was forced by surface wind and atmospheric pressure fields from a 8-member climate model ensemble in order to evaluate dynamics in storm surge levels (SSL) along the European coastline (1) for the baseline period 1970–2000; and (2) during this century under the Representative Concentration Pathways RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Validation simulations, spanning from 2008 to 2014 and driven by ERA-Interim atmospheric forcing, indicated good predictive skill (0.06 m \textbackslash textless RMSE \textbackslash textless 0.29 m and 10 \% \textbackslash textless RMSE \textbackslash textless 29 \% for 110 tidal gauge stations across Europe). Peak-over-threshold extreme value analysis was applied to estimate SSL values for different return periods, and changes of future SSL were obtained from all models to obtain the final ensemble. Values for most scenarios and return periods indicate a projected increase in SSL at several locations along the North European coastline, which is more prominent for RCP8.5 and shows an increasing tendency towards the end of the century for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Projected SSL changes along the European coastal areas south of 50°N show minimal change or even a small decrease, with the exception of RCP8.5 under which a moderate increase is projected towards the end of the century. The present findings indicate that the anticipated increase in extreme total water levels due to relative sea level rise (RSLR), can be further enforced by an increase of the extreme SSL, which can exceed 30 \% of the RSLR, especially for the high return periods and pathway RCP8.5. This implies that the combined effect could increase even further anticipated impacts of climate change for certain European areas and highlights the necessity for timely coastal adaptation and protection measures.

  abstract = {This paper assesses historic changes in mean sea level around the coastline of the North Sea, one of the most densely populated coasts in the world. Typically, such analyses have been conducted at a national level, and detailed geographically wider analyses have not been undertaken for about 20years. We analyse long records (up to 200years) from 30 tide gauge sites, which are reasonably uniformly distributed along the coastline, and: (1) calculate relative sea level trends; (2) examine the inter-annual and decadal variations; (3) estimate regional geocentric (sometimes also referred to as ‘absolute’) sea level rise throughout the 20th century; and (4) assess the evidence for regional acceleration of sea-level rise. Relative sea level changes are broadly consistent with known vertical land movement patterns. The inter-annual and decadal variability is partly coherent across the region, but with some differences between the Inner North Sea and the English Channel. Data sets from various sources are used to provide estimates of the geocentric sea level changes. The long-term geocentric mean sea level trend for the 1900 to 2011 period is estimated to be 1.5±0.1mm/yr for the entire North Sea region. The trend is slightly higher for the Inner North Sea (i.e. 1.6±0.1mm/yr), and smaller but not significantly different on the 95\% confidence level for the English Channel (i.e. 1.2±0.1mm/yr). The uncertainties in the estimates of vertical land movement rates are still large, and the results from a broad range of approaches for determining these rates are not consistent. Periods of sea level rise acceleration are detected at different times throughout the last 200years and are to some extent related to air pressure variations. The recent rates of sea level rise (i.e. over the last two to three decades) are high compared to the long-term average, but are comparable to those which have been observed at other times in the late 19th and 20th century.},

  abstract = {Traditional methods for assessing coastal hazards have not typically incorporated a rigorous treatment of uncertainty. Such treatment is necessary to enable risk assessments which are now required by emerging risk based coastal zone management/planning frameworks. While unresolved issues remain, relating to the availability of sufficient data for comprehensive uncertainty assessments, this will hopefully improve in coming decades. Here, we present a modelling framework which integrates geological, engineering and economic approaches for assessing the climate change driven economic risk to coastal developments. The framework incorporates means for combining results from models that focus on the decadal to century time scales at which coasts evolve, and those that focus on the short term and seasonal time scales (storm bite and recovery). This paper demonstrates the functionality of the framework in deriving probabilistic coastal hazard lines and their subsequent use to establish an economically optimal setback line for development at a case study site; the Narrabeen–Collaroy embayment in Sydney, New South Wales.},

  abstract = {The development, application and behaviour of a generic model of retreating soft rock (e.g. clay) shores is described. This represents a broad system, in coastal modelling terms, comprising shore platform, beach, tidal range, wave transformation, cliff and talus. The coast is divided into a series of representative cross-shore profiles, each of which is discretised into a column of elements. Erosion of a platform element at each timestep depends on its gradient. Material strength is dealt with as a calibration constant, wave forces are averaged over durations of a tide or hour and sediment transport is represented in bulk terms. Attention has been focussed on interaction between system parts and the emergence of system properties, in particular profile shape. This is allowed to develop towards dynamic equilibrium and is the principal means of model validation. The emergence of the profile shape is dominated by the distribution of wave scour by the tide and by interaction with a beach, if present. Because the model is process-based, it may be used to model the effects of climate change and engineering intervention. Yet it is also computationally inexpensive, so may be used to explore uncertainty through probabilistic application. The breadth of the included system, coupled with short run-times, enables predictions over timescales of decades, which we refer to as the Mesoscale. The model is used to explore the dynamics of retreating soft rock shore profiles and to predict future behaviour of a study site.},

In this article, we proposed a new method by combining Google Earth Engine (GEE) with a multiscale convolutional neural network (MSCNN) to extract urban water from Landsat images, which can be summarized as “offline training and online prediction” (OTOP). That is, the training of MSCNN is completed offline, and the process of urban water extraction is implemented on GEE with the trained parameters of MSCNN. The OTOP can give full play to the respective advantages of GEE and the convolutional neural network (CNN), and can make the use of deep learning method in GEE more flexible. The proposed method can process the available satellite images with high performance, without data download and storage, and the overall performance of urban water extraction in the test areas is also higher than that of the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and random forest classifier. The results of the extended validation in the other major cities of China also showed that OTOP is robust and can be used to extract different types of urban water, which benefits from the structural design and training of MSCNN. Therefore, OTOP is especially suitable for the study of large-scale and long-term urban water change detection in the background of urbanization.},

Of all nonland grid cells in GEBCO\_2014, approximately 18\% are based on bathymetric control data, i.e., primarily multibeam and single-beam soundings or preprepared grids which may contain some interpolated values. The GEBCO\_2014 grid has a mean and median depth of 3897 m and 3441 m, respectively.

  abstract = {Deltaic environments are often densely populated with high socio-economic values, and thus are hotspots of climatic, environmental and anthropogenic change. Large scale engineered structures, such as dike systems, have played an important role in shaping both environmental and socio-economic conditions in deltas, with such interventions more likely where there is a high population and a wealthy economy. Engineered interventions interact with the morphological evolution of the delta, reducing or removing sedimentation and accelerating subsidence, increasing the consequences of flooding and necessitating further adaptation. They also encourage further development, reinforcing this feedback. Thus, in these cases, the deltaic landscape and associated livelihoods can be considered to be the result of a coevolution process between natural delta processes and human engineered interventions. This paper explores this hypothesis. It analyses the history of large scale engineering interventions and their implications in five representative, large, populated deltas across the globe (Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna, Yangtze, Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt, Mekong and Nile). The results demonstrate coevolution has occurred and indicate that the response type and the management approach of these engineered structures have significant implications for future delta development. To understand and manage unintended consequences and the development of lock-in trajectories in deltas, a systematic understanding of delta development, including these coevolution processes is essential.},

Images include a diverse range of coastal environments from the U.S. Pacific, Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic, and Great Lakes coastlines, consisting of time-series of high-resolution (\&lt;=1m) orthomosaics and satellite image tiles (10-30m). Each image, image annotation, and labelled image is available as a single zipped file. Each zipped file contains a folder of NPZ format files, and a csv file containing metadata for each labeled image. Zipped folders files follow the following naming convention: \{datasource\}\_\{numberofclasses\}\_\{threedigitdatasetversion\}.zip, where \{datasource\} is the source of the original images (for example, NAIP, Landsat 8, Sentinel 2), \{numberofclasses\} is the number of classes used to annotate the images, and \{threedigitdatasetversion\} is the three-digit code corresponding to the dataset version (in other words, 001 is version 1). Each zipped folder contains a collection of NPZ format files, each of which corresponds to an individual image, and a CSV file with metadata information for every image. An individual NPZ file is named after the image that it represents and contains a collection of the following variables: orig\_image (original input image unedited), image (original input image after color balancing and normalization), classes (list of classes annotated and present in the labelled image), doodles (integer image of all image annotations), color\_doodles (color image of doodles), label (labelled image created from the classes present in the annotations), and settings (annotation and machine learning settings used to generate the labelled image from annotations).

We integrated the terrestrial human footprint and marine cumulative human impact maps in a global assessment of the anthropogenic pressures affecting coastal regions. Of coastal regions globally, 15.5\% had low anthropogenic pressure, mostly in Canada, Russia, and Greenland. Conversely, 47.9\% of coastal regions were heavily affected by humanity, and in most countries (84.1\%) {$>$}50\% of their coastal regions were degraded. Nearly half (43.3\%) of protected areas across coastal regions were exposed to high human pressures. To meet global sustainability objectives, all nations must undertake greater actions to preserve and restore the coastal regions within their borders.},

Managed retreat and sacrifice areas are becoming increasingly popular options, which involve the input of communities and many global examples are given of comparative studies geared to combating erosion - including management theory. In particular setback lines and shoreline management plans are emphasised and coastal erosion management policy decisions for the UK are discussed in detail, as well as examples taken on a global basis.},

One is concerned with the evidence for the apparent acceleration in the rate of global sea level change between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and, thereby, with the question of whether the twentieth century sea level rise was a consequence of an accelerated climate change of anthropogenic origin. An acceleration is indeed observed in both tide gauge and saltmarsh data at different locations around the world, yielding quadratic coefficients ‘c’ of order 0.005 mm/year2, and with the most rapid changes of rate of sea level rise occurring around the end of the nineteenth century. The second topic refers to whether there is evidence that extreme sea levels have increased in recent decades at rates significantly different from those in mean levels. Recent results, which suggest that at most locations rates of change of extreme and mean sea levels are comparable, are presented. In addition, a short review is given of recent work on extreme sea levels by other authors. This body of work, which is focused primarily on Europe and the Mediterranean, also tends to support mean and extreme sea levels changing at similar rates at most locations.},

The sensitivity tests proved that the advanced approach is robust and accurate at the submillimeter per year level of around 0.4 mm yr−1in estimating rates of vertical land movements. It enabled identifying stations displaying large rates of vertical land movements that must be taken into account when predicting future sea level rise and appraising the exposure to its impacts on populations and assets. The average rate of coastal climate-related sea level rise in the Mediterranean Sea was consequently revisited to be of 1.7 mm yr−1 over the past century, whereas the Atlantic northern Iberian coast revealed a significant high rate of sea level rise in excess of 3.4 mm yr−1 for the past 70 years. Future work should consider applying this powerful approach to other geographic contexts as a useful source of supplementary data for geodynamic studies.},

  abstract = {Vertical land motions are a key element in understanding how sea levels have changed over the past century and how future sea levels may impact coastal areas. Ideally, to be useful in long-term sea level studies, vertical land motion should be determined with standard errors that are 1 order of magnitude lower than the contemporary climate signals of 1 to 3 mm/yr observed on average in sea level records, either using tide gauges or satellites. This metrological requirement constitutes a challenge in geodesy. Here we review the most successful instrumental methods that have been used to determine vertical displacements at the Earth's surface, so that the objectives of understanding and anticipating sea levels can be addressed adequately in terms of accuracy. In this respect, the required level of uncertainty is examined in two case studies (global and local). A special focus is given to the use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and to the combination of satellite radar altimetry with tide gauge data. We update previous data analyses and assess the quality of global satellite altimetry products available to the users for coastal applications. Despite recent advances, a near-plateau level of accuracy has been reached. The major limitation is the realization of the terrestrial reference frame, whose physical parameters, the origin and the scale factor, are beyond the scope of a unique technique such as the GPS. Additional practical but nonetheless important issues are associated with the installation of GPS antennas, such as ensuring that there is no unknown differential vertical motion with the tide gauge.},

To date, there have been few large studies looking at the role that type and quality of natural environments may have on these outcomes. The present study used data from a large survey in England (sample analyzed = 4,515), which asked participants to recall a recent visit to nature. After controlling for covariates, respondents recalled greater connectedness to nature and restoration following visits to rural and coastal locations compared with urban green space, and to sites of higher environmental quality (operationalized by protected/designated area status, for example, nature reserves). A series of structural equation analyses provided evidence for a bidirectional association between connectedness and restoration. Consideration of the psychological benefits associated with different types and quality of environment has implications for human health, environmental management, and conservation.},

  abstract = {The shore zone is the most active zone in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere and lithosphere of nature, and has the environmental characteristics of both ocean and land. The ICESat-2 satellite provides height measurements of shore zone using a photon-counting LiDAR. The purpose of this study is to explore the application potential of ICESat-2 satellite data in shore zone classification. Saint Lawrence Island, Alaska, was chosen as the study area. Firstly, in this study, the upper and lower boundaries of the shore zone of the study area were extracted based on Google Earth images. The slope and width between the two boundaries were then calculated according to the formula. Secondly, six statistical indicators (standard deviation, relative standard deviation, average absolute deviation, relative average deviation, absolute median error and quartile deviation) related to the substrate and sediment classification that could reflect the characteristics of the shore zone profile were extracted, and the statistical indicators were used as input parameters of the softmax regression model for classification. Finally, the accuracy of the shore zone classification was validated using the ShoreZone classification system. The results show that, among the 246 shore zone sections in the study area, 86\% (212) has been correctly classified. The results therefore indicate that ICESat-2 data can be used to support the characterization of shore zone morphology.},

  abstract = {The normalized difference water index (NDWI) of McFeeters (1996) was modified by substitution of a middle infrared band such as Landsat TM band 5 for the near infrared band used in the NDWI. The modified NDWI (MNDWI) can enhance open water features while efficiently suppressing and even removing built‐up land noise as well as vegetation and soil noise. The enhanced water information using the NDWI is often mixed with built‐up land noise and the area of extracted water is thus overestimated. Accordingly, the MNDWI is more suitable for enhancing and extracting water information for a water region with a background dominated by built‐up land areas because of its advantage in reducing and even removing built‐up land noise over the NDWI.},

Here we introduce a high-accuracy global DEM at 3″ resolution ( 90 m at the equator) by eliminating major error components from existing DEMs. We separated absolute bias, stripe noise, speckle noise, and tree height bias using multiple satellite data sets and filtering techniques. After the error removal, land areas mapped with ±2 m or better vertical accuracy were increased from 39\% to 58\%. Significant improvements were found in flat regions where height errors larger than topography variability, and landscapes such as river networks and hill-valley structures, became clearly represented. We found the topography slope of previous DEMs was largely distorted in most of world major floodplains (e.g., Ganges, Nile, Niger, and Mekong) and swamp forests (e.g., Amazon, Congo, and Vasyugan). The newly developed DEM will enhance many geoscience applications which are terrain dependent.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing (RS) plays an important role gathering data in many critical domains (e.g., global climate change, risk assessment and vulnerability reduction of natural hazards, resilience of ecosystems, and urban planning). Retrieving, managing, and analyzing large amounts of RS imagery poses substantial challenges. Google Earth Engine (GEE) provides a scalable, cloud-based, geospatial retrieval and processing platform. GEE also provides access to the vast majority of freely available, public, multi-temporal RS data and offers free cloud-based computational power for geospatial data analysis. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are a critical enabling technology to automating the interpretation of RS imagery, particularly on object-based domains, so the integration of AI methods into GEE represents a promising path towards operationalizing automated RS-based monitoring programs. In this article, we provide a systematic review of relevant literature to identify recent research that incorporates AI methods in GEE. We then discuss some of the major challenges of integrating GEE and AI and identify several priorities for future research. We developed an interactive web application designed to allow readers to intuitively and dynamically review the publications included in this literature review.},

  abstract = {Shoreline location and incident wave energy, observed for almost 5 years at Torrey Pines beach, show seasonal fluctuations characteristic of southern California beaches. The shoreline location, defined as the cross-shore position of the mean sea level contour, retreats by almost 40 m in response to energetic winter waves and gradually recovers during low-energy summer waves. Hourly estimates of incident wave energy and weekly to monthly surveys of the shoreline location are used to develop and calibrate an equilibrium-type shoreline change model. By hypothesis, the shoreline change rate depends on both the wave energy and the wave energy disequilibrium with the shoreline location. Using calibrated values of four model free parameters, observed and modeled shoreline location are well correlated at Torrey Pines and two additional survey sites. Model free parameters can be estimated with as little as 2 years of monthly observations or with about 5 years of ideally timed, biannual observations. Wave energy time series used to calibrate and test the model must resolve individual storms, and model performance is substantially degraded by using weekly to monthly averaged wave energy. Variations of free parameter values between sites may be associated with variations in sand grain size, sediment availability, and other factors. The model successfully reproduces shoreline location for time periods not used in tuning and can be used to predict beach response to past or hypothetical future wave climates. However, the model will fail when neglected geologic factors are important (e.g., underlying bedrock limits erosion or sand availability limits accretion).},

Recently, deep learning-based cloud detection meth­ ods have shown their potential for cloud detection but they can only be applied locally, leading to inefficient data downloading time and storage problems. This letter proposes a method to directly perform cloud detection in Landsat-8 imagery in GEE based on deep learning (DeepGEE-CD). A deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) was first trained locally, and then the trained DCNN was deployed in the JavaScript client of GEE. An experiment was undertaken to validate the proposed method with a set of Landsat-8 images and the results show that DeepGEECD outperformed the widely used function of mask (Fmask) algo­ rithm. The proposed DeepGEE-CD approach can accurately detect cloud in Landsat-8 imagery without downloading it, making it a promising method for routine cloud detection of Landsat-8 ima­ gery in GEE.},

Considering the low-level features (e.g., spectral and texture) as the bottom level, the output feature representation from the top level of the network can be directly fed into a subsequent classifier for pixel-based classification. As a matter of fact, by carefully addressing the practical demands in RS applications and designing the input?output levels of the whole network, we have found that DL is actually everywhere in RS data analysis: from the traditional topics of image preprocessing, pixel-based classification, and target recognition, to the recent challenging tasks of high-level semantic feature extraction and RS scene understanding.In this technical tutorial, a general framework of DL for RS data is provided, and the state-of-the-art DL methods in RS are regarded as special cases of input-output data combined with various deep networks and tuning tricks. Although extensive experimental results confirm the excellent performance of the DL-based algorithms in RS big data analysis, even more exciting prospects can be expected for DL in RS. Key bottlenecks and potential directions are also indicated in this article, guiding further research into DL for RS data.},

The resulting inundation from rising seas will heavily impact low-lying areas; at least 100 million persons live within one meter of mean sea level and are at increased risk in the coming decades. The very existence of some island states and deltaic coasts is threatened by sea level rise. An additional threat affecting some of the most heavily developed and economically valuable real estate will come from an exacerbation of sandy beach erosion. As the beach is lost, fixed structures nearby are increasingly exposed to the direct impact of storm waves, and will ultimately be damaged or destroyed unless expensive protective measures are taken. It has long been speculated that the underlying rate of long-term sandy beach erosion is two orders of magnitude greater than the rate of rise of sea level, so that any significant increase of sea level has dire consequences for coastal inhabitants. We present in this paper an analytical treatment that indicates there is a highly multiplicative association between long-term sandy beach erosion and sea level rise, and use a large and consistent data base of shoreline position field data to show that there is reasonable quantitative agreement with observations of 19th and 20th century sea levels and coastal erosion. This result means that the already-severe coastal erosion problems witnessed in the 20th century will be exacerbated in the 21st century under plausible global warming scenarios.},

  abstract = {Google Earth Engine (GEE) provides a convenient platform that enables the use of a diverse array of applications based on optical satellite images covering long time periods and large areas. However, cloud contamination often causes optical satellite images to lose land surface information, which can greatly affect their spatial and temporal availability in areas with frequent cloud cover. Reconstructing the missing values is very important when researchers attempt to improve the potential for using optical satellite images. Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods have shown great potential in cloud removal. Unfortunately, current CNN-based cloud removal methods can only be applied locally, which would result in inefficient data downloading and storage problems. To address these problems, this paper proposes a method that integrates GEE data and a multi-level feature connected CNN (DeepGEE-S2CR) to remove clouds in Sentinel-2 imagery using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery as auxiliary data. Specifically, the training process of the multi-level feature connected CNN was conducted locally, so that cloud removal could then be performed on the client of GEE using online data with the trained CNN model. An experiment using a set of globally distributed Sentinel-2 images was conducted to validate the proposed method; the results showed the process could generate results comparable to a classic deep Sentinel-2 cloud removal method (DSen2-CR) that should be run locally (the average root mean square errors of DeepGEE-S2CR and DSen2-CR were 0.045 and 0.042, respectively). The proposed method is especially convenient for removing clouds in Sentinel-2 imagery covering a large area.},

However, it is very expensive and time-consuming to pairwise label large-scale bitemporal HSR remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose single-temporal supervised learning (STAR) for change detection from a new perspective of exploiting object changes in unpaired images as supervisory signals. STAR enables us to train a high-accuracy change detector only using \textbackslash textbf\{unpaired\} labeled images and generalize to real-world bitemporal images. To evaluate the effectiveness of STAR, we design a simple yet effective change detector called ChangeStar, which can reuse any deep semantic segmentation architecture by the ChangeMixin module. The comprehensive experimental results show that ChangeStar outperforms the baseline with a large margin under single-temporal supervision and achieves superior performance under bitemporal supervision.

  abstract = {Geospatial object segmentation, as a particular semantic segmentation task, always faces with larger-scale variation, larger intra-class variance of background, and foreground-background imbalance in the high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing imagery. However, general semantic segmentation methods mainly focus on scale variation in the natural scene, with inadequate consideration of the other two problems that usually happen in the large area earth observation scene. In this paper, we argue that the problems lie on the lack of foreground modeling and propose a foreground-aware relation network (FarSeg) from the perspectives of relation-based and optimization-based foreground modeling, to alleviate the above two problems. From perspective of relation, FarSeg enhances the discrimination of foreground features via foreground-correlated contexts associated by learning foreground-scene relation. Meanwhile, from perspective of optimization, a foregroundaware optimization is proposed to focus on foreground examples and hard examples of background during training for a balanced optimization. The experimental results obtained using a large scale dataset suggest that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art general semantic segmentation methods and achieves a better trade-off between speed and accuracy.

  abstract = {The assessment of coastal vulnerability to erosion is urgently needed due to increasing coastal erosion globally. Based on the coastal characteristics of the Xiamen artificial coastline, which accounts for more than 80\% of the coastline in this area, this study provides an integrated approach based on a multi-criteria index. The evaluation index system of the local coastal vulnerability to the erosion of Xiamen includes 12 indexes based on natural (coastal characteristics, coastal forcing), and socio-economic factors (coastal infrastructure, disaster reduction). The spatial differentiation characteristics of the coastal vulnerability to erosion along the Xiamen coast (2018) have been quantitatively assessed with the aid of GIS (Geographic Information System) and RS (Remote Sensing) technology. The results show that the very high vulnerability, high vulnerability, medium vulnerability, low vulnerability and very low vulnerability areas of coastal erosion accounted for 4.6\%, 30.5\%, 51.6\%, 12.5\% and 0.8\% of the Xiamen coast, respectively. The coastal vulnerability to erosion classes of artificial coasts is significantly higher than those of natural coasts. This difference is mainly controlled by the coastal slope and coastal buffer ability. The results of the evaluation are basically consistent with the present situation. The rationality of the index system and the applicability of the theoretical method are well explained. The evaluation model constructed in this study can be extended to other areas with high ratios of artificial coasts.},

In particular, deep learning has proven to be both a major breakthrough and an extremely powerful tool in many fields. Shall we embrace deep learning as the key to everything? Or should we resist a black-box solution? These are controversial issues within the remote-sensing community. In this article, we analyze the challenges of using deep learning for remote-sensing data analysis, review recent advances, and provide resources we hope will make deep learning in remote sensing seem ridiculously simple. More importantly, we encourage remote-sensing scientists to bring their expertise into deep learning and use it as an implicit general model to tackle unprecedented, large-scale, influential challenges, such as climate change and urbanization.},
