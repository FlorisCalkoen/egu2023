@ARTICLE{hammanPangeoBigdataEcosystem2018,
  ABSTRACT = {Data intensive scientific workflows are at a pivotal time in which traditional local computing resources are no longer capable of meeting the storage or computing demands of scientists. In the Earth System Sciences (ESS) community, we are facing an explosion of data volumes where new datasets, sourced from models, in-situ observations, and remote sensing platforms, are being made available at prohibitively large volumes to store and work with using conventional computational approaches. Furthermore, there is a growing recognition that the fragmentation of software tools and environments renders most geoscientific research effectively unreproducible and prone to failure. While the private data-science community has been actively developing big-data and open-source solutions to these problems, the academic community has begun to lag, leading to a growing technology gap between the two sectors. Pangeo is a community driven effort for open-source big-data in the Earth System Sciences. Pangeo's mission is to cultivate an ecosystem in which the next generation of open-source analysis tools for the geosciences can be developed, distributed, and sustained. In this presentation, we will introduce the core concepts driving the development throughout the Pangeo community and will describe our recent efforts towards 1) closing the gaps in scalability and technology and 2) building an interdisciplinary community to develop and sustain the technology needed to leverage big data in ESS. We will discuss the core software libraries of the Pangeo ecosystem, Python, Xarray, Dask, and Jupyter and will provide examples of how these tools, when deployed on both high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud computing systems are allowing scientists to scale their workflows on large datasets.},

@ARTICLE{ranasingheNeedNewGeneration2020,
  ABSTRACT = {The combination of climate change impacts, declining fluvial sediment supply, and heavy human utilization of the coastal zone, arguably the most populated and developed land zone in the world, will very likely lead to massive socio-economic and environmental losses in the coming decades. Effective coastal planning/management strategies that can help circumvent such losses require reliable local scale ({$<\sptilde$}10\,km) projections of coastal change resulting from the integrated effect of climate change driven variations in mean sea level, storm surge, waves, and riverflows. Presently available numerical models are unable to adequately fulfill this need. A new generation of multi-scale, probabilistic coastal change models is urgently needed to comprehensively assess and optimise coastal risk at local scale, enabling risk informed, climate proof adaptation measures that strike a good balance between risk and reward.},

@ARTICLE{turnerSatelliteOpticalImagery2021,
  ABSTRACT = {This Short Communication provides a Coastal Engineering perspective on present and emerging capabilities of satellite optical imagery, including real-world applications that can now be realistically implemented from the desktop. Significantly, at the vast majority of locations worldwide, satellite remote sensing is currently the only source of information to complement much more limited in-situ instrumentation for land and sea mapping, monitoring and measurement. Less well recognised is that publicly available, routinely sampled and now easily accessible optical imagery covering virtually every position along the world's coastlines already spans multiple decades. In the past five years the common obstacles of (1) limited access to high-performance computing and (2) specialist remote sensing technical expertise, have been largely removed. The emergence of several internet-accessible application programming interfaces (APIs) now enable applied users to access petabytes of satellite imagery along with the necessary tools and processing power to extract, manipulate and analyse information of practical interest. Following a brief overview and timeline of civilian Earth observations from space, satellite-derived shorelines (SDS) and satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) are used to introduce and demonstrate some of the present real-world capabilities of satellite optical imagery most relevant to coastal professionals and researchers. These practical examples illustrate the use of satellite imagery to monitor and quantify both engineered and storm-induced coastline changes, as well as the emerging potential to obtain seamless topo/bathy surveys along coastal regions. Significantly, timescales of satellite-derived changes at the coast can range from decades to days, with spatial scales of interest extending from individual project sites up to unprecedented regional and global studies. While we foresee the uptake and routine use of satellite-derived information becoming quickly ubiquitous within the Coastal Engineering profession, on-ground observations are – and in our view will remain - fundamentally important. Compared to precision in-situ instrumentation, present intrinsic limitations of satellites are their relatively low rates of revisit and decimetre spatial accuracy. New satellite advances including ‘video from space’ and the potential to combine Earth observation with numerical and data-driven coastal models through assimilation and artificial intelligence are advances that we foresee will have future major impact in Coastal Engineering.},

@ARTICLE{vosCoastSatGoogleEarth2019,
  ABSTRACT = {CoastSat is an open-source software toolkit written in Python that enables the user to obtain time-series of shoreline position at any sandy coastline worldwide from 30+~years (and growing) of publicly available satellite imagery. The toolkit exploits the capabilities of Google Earth Engine to efficiently retrieve Landsat and Sentinel-2 images cropped to any user-defined region of interest. The resulting images are pre-processed to remove cloudy pixels and enhance spatial resolution, before applying a robust and generic shoreline detection algorithm. This novel shoreline detection technique combines a supervised image classification and a sub-pixel resolution border segmentation to map the position of the shoreline with an accuracy of \textasciitilde 10~m. The purpose of CoastSat is to provide coastal managers, engineers and scientists a user-friendly and practical toolkit to monitor and explore their coastlines. The software is freely-available on GitHub (https://github.com/kvos/CoastSat) and is accompanied by guided examples (Jupyter Notebook) plus step-by-step README documentation.},
